Schrecklich ist es, deiner Wahrheit
Sterbliches Gefäss zu seyn.
</p>
Schiller.
<p>
<span>High fate is theirs, ye sleepless waves, whose ear</span>
			<br/>
<span>Learns Freedom's lesson from your voice of fear;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Whose spell-bound sense from childhood's hour hath known</span>
			<br/>
<span>Familiar meanings in your mystic tone:</span>
			<br/>
<span>Sounds of deep import—voices that beguile</span>
			<br/>
<span>Age of its tears and childhood of its smile,</span>
			<br/>
<span>To yearn with speechless impulse to the free</span>
			<br/>
<span>And gladsome greetings of the buoyant sea!</span>
			<br/>
<span>High fate is theirs, who where the silent sky</span>
			<br/>
<span>Stoops to the soaring mountains, live and die;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Who scale the cloud-capt height, or sink to rest</span>
			<br/>
<span>In the deep stillness of its shelt'ring breast;—</span>
			<br/>
<span>Around whose feet the exulting waves have sung,</span>
			<br/>
<span>The eternal hills their giant shadows flung.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="i1">No wonders nurs'd thy childhood; not for thee</span>
			<br/>
<span>Did the waves chant their song of liberty!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Thine was no mountain home, where Freedom's form</span>
			<br/>
<span>Abides enthron'd amid the mist and storm,</span>
			<br/>
<span>And whispers to the listening winds, that swell</span>
			<br/>
<span>With solemn cadence round her citadel!</span>
			<br/>
<span>These had no sound for thee: that cold calm eye</span>
			<br/>
<span>Lit with no rapture as the storm swept by,</span>
			<br/>
<span>To mark with shiver'd crest the reeling wave</span>
			<br/>
<span>Hide his torn head beneath his sunless cave;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Or hear 'mid circling crags, the impatient cry</span>
			<br/>
<span>Of the pent winds, that scream in agony!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Yet all high sounds that mountain children hear</span>
			<br/>
<span>Flash'd from thy soul upon thine inward ear;</span>
			<br/>
<span>All Freedom's mystic language—storms that roar</span>
			<br/>
<span>By hill or wave, the mountain or the shore,—</span>
			<br/>
<span>All these had stirr'd thy spirit, and thine eye</span>
			<br/>
<span>In common sights read secret sympathy;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Till all bright thoughts that hills or waves can yield</span>
			<br/>
<span>Deck'd the dull waste, and the familiar field;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Or wondrous sounds from tranquil skies were borne</span>
			<br/>
<span>Far o'er the glistening sheets of windy corn:</span>
			<br/>
<span>Skies—that, unbound by clasp of mountain chain,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Slope stately down, and melt into the plain;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Sounds—such as erst the lone wayfaring man</span>
			<br/>
<span>Caught, as he journeyed, from the lips of Pan;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Or that mysterious cry, that smote with fear,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Like sounds from other worlds, the Spartan's ear,</span>
			<br/>
<span>While o'er the dusty plain, the murmurous throng</span>
			<br/>
<span>Of Heaven's embattled myriads swept along.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="i1">Say not such dreams are idle: for the man</span>
			<br/>
<span>Still toils to perfect what the child began;</span>
			<br/>
<span>And thoughts, that were but outlines, time engraves</span>
			<br/>
<span>Deep on his life; and childhood's baby waves,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Made rough with care, become the changeful sea,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Stemm'd by the strength of manhood fearlessly;</span>
			<br/>
<span>And fleeting thoughts, that on the lonely wild</span>
			<br/>
<span>Swept o'er the fancy of that heedless child,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Perchance had quicken'd with a living truth</span>
			<br/>
<span>The cold dull soil of his unfruitful youth;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Till with his daily life, a life that threw</span>
			<br/>
<span>Its shadows o'er the future flower'd and grew,</span>
			<br/>
<span>With common cares unmingling, and apart,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Haunting the shrouded chambers of his heart;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Till life unstirr'd by action, life became</span>
			<br/>
<span>Threaded and lighten'd by a track of flame;</span>
			<br/>
<span>An inward light, that, with its streaming ray</span>
			<br/>
<span>On the dark current of his changeless day,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Bound all his being with a silver chain—</span>
			<br/>
<span>Like a swift river through a silent plain!</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="i1">High thoughts were his, when by the gleaming flood,</span>
			<br/>
<span>With heart new strung, and stern resolve, he stood;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Where rode the tall dark ships, whose loosen'd sail</span>
			<br/>
<span>All idly flutter'd in the eastern gale;</span>
			<br/>
<span>High thoughts were his; but Memory's glance the while</span>
			<br/>
<span>Fell on the cherish'd past with tearful smile;</span>
			<br/>
<span>And peaceful joys and gentler thoughts swept by,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Like summer lightnings o'er a darken'd sky.</span>
			<br/>
<span>The peace of childhood, and the thoughts that roam,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Like loving shadows, round that childhood's home;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Joys that had come and vanish'd, half unknown,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Then slowly brighten'd, as the days had flown;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Years that were sweet or sad, becalm'd or toss'd</span>
			<br/>
<span>On life's wild waves—the living and the lost.</span>
			<br/>
<span>Youth stain'd with follies: and the thoughts of ill</span>
			<br/>
<span>Crush'd, as they rose, by manhood's sterner will.</span>
			<br/>
<span>Repentant prayers, that had been strong to save;</span>
			<br/>
<span>And the first sorrow, which is childhood's grave!</span>
			<br/>
<span>All shapes that haunt remembrance—soft and fair,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Like a green land at sunset, all were there!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Eyes that he knew, old faces unforgot,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Gaz'd sadly down on his unrestful lot,</span>
			<br/>
<span>And Memory's calm clear voice, and mournful eye,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Chill'd every buoyant hope that floated by;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Like frozen winds on southern vales that blow</span>
			<br/>
<span>From a far land—the children of the snow—</span>
			<br/>
<span>O'er flowering plain and blossom'd meadow fling</span>
			<br/>
<span>The cold dull shadow of their icy wing.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="i1">Then Fancy's roving visions, bold and free,</span>
			<br/>
<span>A moment dispossess'd reality.</span>
			<br/>
<span>All airy hopes that idle hearts can frame,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Like dreams between two sorrows, went and came:</span>
			<br/>
<span>Fond hearts that fain would clothe the unwelcome truth</span>
			<br/>
<span>Of toilsome manhood in the dreams of youth,</span>
			<br/>
<span>To bend in rapture at some idle throne,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Some lifeless soulless phantom of their own;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Some shadowy vision of a tranquil life,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Of joys unclouded, years unstirr'd by strife;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Of sleep unshadow'd by a dream of woe;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Of many a lawny hill, and streams with silver flow;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Of giant mountains by the western main,</span>
			<br/>
<span>The sunless forest, and the sealike plain;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Those lingering hopes of coward hearts, that still</span>
			<br/>
<span>Would play the traitor to the steadfast will,</span>
			<br/>
<span>One moment's space, perchance, might charm his eye</span>
			<br/>
<span>From the stern future, and the years gone by.</span>
			<br/>
<span>One moment's space might waft him far away</span>
			<br/>
<span>To western shores—the death-place of the day!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Might paint the calm, sweet peace—the rest of home,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Far o'er the pathless waste of laboring foam—</span>
			<br/>
<span>Peace, that recall'd his childish hours anew,</span>
			<br/>
<span>More calm, more deep, than childhood ever knew!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Green happy places, like a flowery lea</span>
			<br/>
<span>Between the barren mountains and the stormy sea.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="i1">O pleasant rest, if once the race were run!</span>
			<br/>
<span>O happy slumber, if the day were done!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Dreams that were sweet at eve, at morn were sin;</span>
			<br/>
<span>With cares to conquer, and a goal to win!</span>
			<br/>
<span>His were no tranquil years—no languid sleep—</span>
			<br/>
<span>No life of dreams—no home beyond the deep—</span>
			<br/>
<span>No softening ray—no visions false and wild—</span>
			<br/>
<span>No glittering hopes on life's gray distance smiled—</span>
			<br/>
<span>Like isles of sunlight on a mountain's brow,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Lit by a wandering gleam, we know not how,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Far on the dim horizon, when the sky</span>
			<br/>
<span>With glooming clouds broods dark and heavily.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="i1">Then his eye slumber'd, and the chain was broke</span>
			<br/>
<span>That bound his spirit, and his heart awoke;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Then, like a kingly river swift and strong,</span>
			<br/>
<span>The future roll'd its gathering tides along!</span>
			<br/>
<span>The shout of onset and the shriek of fear</span>
			<br/>
<span>Smote, like the rush of waters, on his ear;</span>
			<br/>
<span>And his eye kindled with the kindling fray,</span>
			<br/>
<span>The surging battle and the mail'd array!</span>
			<br/>
<span>All wondrous deeds the coming days should see,</span>
			<br/>
<span>And the long Vision of the years to be.</span>
			<br/>
<span>Pale phantom hosts, like shadows, faint and far,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Councils, and armies, and the pomp of war!</span>
			<br/>
<span>And one sway'd all, who wore a kingly crown,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Until another rose and smote him down:</span>
			<br/>
<span>A form that tower'd above his brother men;</span>
			<br/>
<span>A form he knew—but it was shrouded then!</span>
			<br/>
<span>With stern, slow steps, unseen yet still the same,</span>
			<br/>
<span>By leaguer'd tower and tented field it came;</span>
			<br/>
<span>By Naseby's hill, o'er Marston's heathy waste,</span>
			<br/>
<span>By Worcester's field, the warrior-vision pass'd!</span>
			<br/>
<span>From their deep base, thy beetling cliffs, Dunbar,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Rang, as he trode them, with the voice of war!</span>
			<br/>
<span>The soldier kindled at his words of fire;</span>
			<br/>
<span>The statesman quail'd before his glance of ire!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Worn was his brow with cares no thought could scan,</span>
			<br/>
<span>His step was loftier than the steps of man;</span>
			<br/>
<span>And the winds told his glory, and the wave</span>
			<br/>
<span>Sonorous witness to his empire gave!</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="i1">What forms are these, that with complaining sound,</span>
			<br/>
<span>And slow reluctant steps are gathering round?</span>
			<br/>
<span>Forms that with him shall tread life's changing stage,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Cross his lone path, or share his pilgrimage.</span>
			<br/>
<span>There, as he gazed, a wond'rous band—they came,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Pym's look of hate, and Strafford's glance of flame:</span>
			<br/>
<span>There Laud, with noiseless steps and glittering eye,</span>
			<br/>
<span>In priestly garb, a frail old man, went by;</span>
			<br/>
<span>His drooping head bowed meekly on his breast;</span>
			<br/>
<span>His hands were folded, like a saint at rest!</span>
			<br/>
<span>There Hampden bent him o'er his saddle bow,</span>
			<br/>
<span>And death's cold dews bedimm'd his earnest brow;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Still turn'd to watch the battle—still forgot</span>
			<br/>
<span>Himself, his sufferings, in his country's lot!</span>
			<br/>
<span>There Falkland eyed the strife that would not cease,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Shook back his tangled locks, and murmur'd "Peace!"</span>
			<br/>
<span>With feet that spurn'd the ground, lo! Milton there</span>
			<br/>
<span>Stood like a statue; and his face was fair—</span>
			<br/>
<span>Fair beyond human beauty; and his eye,</span>
			<br/>
<span>That knew not earth, soar'd upwards to the sky!</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="i1">He, too, was there—it was the princely boy,</span>
			<br/>
<span>The child-companion of his childish joy!</span>
			<br/>
<span>But oh! how chang'd! those deathlike features wore</span>
			<br/>
<span>Childhood's bright glance and sunny smile no more!</span>
			<br/>
<span>That brow so sad, so pale, so full of care—</span>
			<br/>
<span>What trace of careless childhood linger'd there?</span>
			<br/>
<span>What spring of youth in that majestic mien,</span>
			<br/>
<span>So sadly calm, so kingly, so serene?</span>
			<br/>
<span>No—all was chang'd! the monarch wept alone,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Between a ruin'd church and shatter'd throne!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Friendless and hopeless—like a lonely tree,</span>
			<br/>
<span>On some bare headland straining mournfully,</span>
			<br/>
<span>That all night long its weary moan doth make</span>
			<br/>
<span>To the vex'd waters of a mountain lake!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Still, as he gaz'd, the phantom's mournful glance</span>
			<br/>
<span>Shook the deep slumber of his deathlike trance;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Like some forgotten strain that haunts us still,</span>
			<br/>
<span>That calm eye follow'd, turn him where he will;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Till the pale monarch, and the long array,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Pass'd like a morning mist, in tears away!</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="i1">Then all his dream was troubled, and his soul</span>
			<br/>
<span>Thrill'd with a dread no slumber could control;</span>
			<br/>
<span>On that dark form his eyes had gaz'd before,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Nor known it then;—but it was veil'd no more!</span>
			<br/>
<span>In broad clear light the ghastly vision shone,—</span>
			<br/>
<span>That form was his,—those features were his own!</span>
			<br/>
<span>The night of terrors, and the day of care,</span>
			<br/>
<span>The years of toil—all, all were written there!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Sad faces watch'd around him, and his breath</span>
			<br/>
<span>Came faint and feeble in the embrace of death.</span>
			<br/>
<span>The gathering tempest, with its voice of fear,</span>
			<br/>
<span>His latest loftiest music smote his ear!</span>
			<br/>
<span>That day of boundless hope and promise high,</span>
			<br/>
<span>That day that hail'd his triumphs, saw him die!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Then from those whitening lips, as death drew near,</span>
			<br/>
<span>The imprisoning chains fell off, and all was clear!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Like lowering clouds, that at the close of day,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Bath'd in a blaze of sunset, melt away;</span>
			<br/>
<span>And with its clear calm tones, that dying prayer</span>
			<br/>
<span>Cheer'd all the failing hearts that sorrow'd there!</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="i1">A life—whose ways no human thought could scan;</span>
			<br/>
<span>A life—that was not as the life of man;</span>
			<br/>
<span>A life—that wrote its purpose with a sword,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Moulding itself into action, not in word!</span>
			<br/>
<span>Rent with tumultuous thoughts, whose conflict rung</span>
			<br/>
<span>Deep through his soul, and chok'd his faltering tongue;</span>
			<br/>
<span>A heart that reck'd not of the countless dead,</span>
			<br/>
<span>That strew'd the blood-stain'd path where Empire led;</span>
			<br/>
<span>A daring hand, that shrunk not to fulfil</span>
			<br/>
<span>The thought that spurr'd it; and a dauntless will,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Bold action's parent; and a piercing ken</span>
			<br/>
<span>Through the dark chambers of the hearts of men,</span>
			<br/>
<span>To read each thought, and teach that master-mind</span>
			<br/>
<span>The fears and hopes and passions of mankind;</span>
			<br/>
<span>All these were thine—oh thought of fear!—and thou,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Stretch'd on that bed of death, art nothing now.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="i1">Then all his vision faded, and his soul</span>
			<br/>
<span>Sprang from its sleep! and lo! the waters roll</span>
			<br/>
<span>Once more beneath him; and the fluttering sail,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Where the dark ships rode proudly, woo'd the gale;</span>
			<br/>
<span>And the wind murmur'd round him, and he stood</span>
			<br/>
<span>Once more alone beside the gleaming flood.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Who taught this pleading to unpractised eyes?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who hid such import in an infant’s gloom?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who lent thee, child, this meditative guise?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who mass’d, round that slight brow, these clouds of doom?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lo! sails that gleam a moment and are gone;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The swinging waters, and the cluster’d pier.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not idly Earth and Ocean labour on,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor idly do these sea-birds hover near.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But thou, whom superfluity of joy</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wafts not from thine own thoughts, nor longings vain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor weariness, the full-fed soul’s annoy⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Remaining in thy hunger and thy pain;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou, drugging pain by patience; half averse</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From thine own mother’s breast, that knows not thee;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With eyes which sought thine eyes thou didst converse,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And that soul-searching vision fell on me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Glooms that go deep as thine I have not known:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Moods of fantastic sadness, nothing worth.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thy sorrow and thy calmness are thine own:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Glooms that enhance and glorify this earth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What mood wears like complexion to thy woe?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His, who in mountain glens, at noon of day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sits rapt, and hears the battle break below?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Ah! thine was not the shelter, but the fray.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some exile’s, mindful how the past was glad?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some angel’s, in an alien planet born?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—No exile’s dream was ever half so sad,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor any angel’s sorrow so forlorn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Is the calm thine of stoic souls, who weigh</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Life well, and find it wanting, nor deplore;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But in disdainful silence turn away,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stand mute, self-centred, stern, and dream no more?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or do I wait, to hear some gray-hair’d king</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Unravel all his many-colour’d lore;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose mind hath known all arts of governing,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mused much, loved life a little, loathed it more?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Down the pale cheek long lines of shadow slope,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which years, and curious thought, and suffering give.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Thou hast foreknown the vanity of hope,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Foreseen thy harvest⁠—yet proceed’st to live.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O meek anticipant of that sure pain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose sureness gray-hair’d scholars hardly learn!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What wonder shall time breed, to swell thy strain?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What heavens, what earth, what sun shalt thou discern?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ere the long night, whose stillness brooks no star,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Match that funereal aspect with her pall,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I think, thou wilt have fathom’d life too far,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have known too much⁠—⁠or else forgotten all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Guide of our dark steps a triple veil</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Betwixt our senses and our sorrow keeps;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath sown with cloudless passages the tale</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of grief, and eased us with a thousand sleeps.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! not the nectarous poppy lovers use,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not daily labour’s dull, Lethæan spring,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Oblivion in lost angels can infuse</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the soil’d glory, and the trailing wing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And though thou glean, what strenuous gleaners may,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the throng’d fields where winning comes by strife;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And though the just sun gild, as mortals pray,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some reaches of thy storm-vext stream of life;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though that blank sunshine blind thee; though the cloud</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That sever’d the world’s march and thine, be gone;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though ease dulls grace, and Wisdom be too proud</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To halve a lodging that was all her own⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Once, ere the day decline, thou shalt discern,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Oh once, ere night, in thy success, thy chain!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ere the long evening close, thou shalt return,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And wear this majesty of grief again.</span>

			<p>
				<span>“Not by the justice that my father spurn’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not for the thousands whom my father slew,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Altars unfed and temples overturn’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cold hearts and thankless tongues, where thanks are due;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fell this dread voice from lips that cannot lie,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stern sentence of the Powers of Destiny.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I will unfold my sentence and my crime.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My crime⁠—that, rapt in reverential awe,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I sate obedient, in the fiery prime</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of youth, self-govern’d, at the feet of Law;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ennobling this dull pomp, the life of kings,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By contemplation of diviner things.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My father loved injustice, and lived long;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crown’d with gray hairs he died, and full of sway.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I loved the good he scorn’d, and hated wrong⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Gods declare my recompence to-day.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I look’d for life more lasting, rule more high;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And when six years are measured, lo, I die!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet surely, O my people, did I deem</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Man’s justice from the all-just Gods was given;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A light that from some upper fount did beam,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some better archetype, whose seat was heaven;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A light that, shining from the blest abodes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Did shadow somewhat of the life of Gods.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Mere phantoms of man’s self-tormenting heart,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which on the sweets that woo it dares not feed!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Vain dreams, which quench our pleasures, then depart,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When the duped soul, self-master’d, claims its meed;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When, on the strenuous just man, Heaven bestows,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crown of his struggling life, an unjust close!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Seems it so light a thing, then, austere Powers,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To spurn man’s common lure, life’s pleasant things?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Seems there no joy in dances crown’d with flowers,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Love, free to range, and regal banquetings?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bend ye on these, indeed, an unmoved eye,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not Gods but ghosts, in frozen apathy?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Or is it that some Force, too wise, too strong,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Even for yourselves to conquer or beguile,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sweeps earth, and heaven, and men, and gods along,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like the broad volume of the insurgent Nile?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the great powers we serve, themselves may be</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Slaves of a tyrannous necessity?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Or in mid-heaven, perhaps, your golden cars,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where earthly voice climbs never, wing their flight,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And in wild hunt, through mazy tracts of stars,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sweep in the sounding stillness of the night?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or in deaf ease, on thrones of dazzling sheen,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Drinking deep draughts of joy, ye dwell serene?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh, wherefore cheat our youth, if thus it be,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of one short joy, one lust, one pleasant dream?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stringing vain words of powers we cannot see,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Blind divinations of a will supreme;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lost labour! when the circumambient gloom</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But hides, if Gods, Gods careless of our doom?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The rest I give to joy. Even while I speak,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My sand runs short; and⁠—as yon star-shot ray,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hemm’d by two banks of cloud, peers pale and weak,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Now, as the barrier closes, dies away⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Even so do past and future intertwine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Blotting this six years’ space, which yet is mine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Six years⁠—six little years⁠—six drops of time!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet suns shall rise, and many moons shall wane,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And old men die, and young men pass their prime,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And languid pleasure fade and flower again,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the dull Gods behold, ere these are flown,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Revels more deep, joy keener than their own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Into the silence of the groves and woods</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I will go forth; though something would I say⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Something⁠—yet what, I know not; for the Gods</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The doom they pass revoke not, nor delay;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And prayers, and gifts, and tears, are fruitless all,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the night waxes, and the shadows fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye men of Egypt, ye have heard your king!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I go, and I return not. But the will</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the great Gods is plain; and ye must bring</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ill deeds, ill passions, zealous to fulfil</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their pleasure, to their feet; and reap their praise,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The praise of Gods, rich boon! and length of days.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—So spake he, half in anger, half in scorn;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And one loud cry of grief and of amaze</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Broke from his sorrowing people; so he spake,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And turning, left them there; and with brief pause,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Girt with a throng of revellers, bent his way</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To the cool region of the groves he loved.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There by the river-banks he wander’d on,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From palm-grove on to palm-grove, happy trees,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their smooth tops shining sunward, and beneath</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Burying their unsunn’d stems in grass and flowers;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where in one dream the feverish time of youth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Might fade in slumber, and the feet of joy</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Might wander all day long and never tire.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here came the king, holding high feast, at morn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rose-crown’d; and ever, when the sun went down,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A hundred lamps beam’d in the tranquil gloom,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From tree to tree all through the twinkling grove,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Revealing all the tumult of the feast⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Flush’d guests, and golden goblets foam’d with wine;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>While the deep-burnish’d foliage overhead</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Splinter’d the silver arrows of the moon.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It may be that sometimes his wondering soul</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From the loud joyful laughter of his lips</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Might shrink half startled, like a guilty man</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who wrestles with his dream; as some pale shape</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gliding half hidden through the dusky stems,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Would thrust a hand before the lifted bowl,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whispering: <i>A little space, and thou art mine!</i></span>
						<br/>
				<span>It may be on that joyless feast his eye</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dwelt with mere outward seeming; he, within,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Took measure of his soul, and knew its strength,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And by that silent knowledge, day by day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Was calm’d, ennobled, comforted, sustain’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It may be; but not less his brow was smooth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And his clear laugh fled ringing through the gloom,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And his mirth quail’d not at the mild reproof</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sigh’d out by winter’s sad tranquillity;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor, pall’d with its own fulness, ebb’d and died</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the rich languor of long summer-days;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor wither’d when the palm-tree plumes, that roof’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With their mild dark his grassy banquet-hall,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bent to the cold winds of the showerless spring;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No, nor grew dark when autumn brought the clouds.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So six long years he revell’d, night and day.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And when the mirth wax’d loudest, with dull sound</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sometimes from the grove’s centre echoes came,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To tell his wondering people of their king;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the still night, across the steaming flats,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mix’d with the murmur of the moving Nile.</span>

<h2 epub:type="title">THE HAYSWATER BOAT.</h2>
<p>
<span>A region desolate and wild.</span>
			<br/>
<span>Black, chafing water: and afloat,</span>
			<br/>
<span>And lonely as a truant child</span>
			<br/>
<span>In a waste wood, a single boat:</span>
			<br/>
<span>No mast, no sails are set thereon;</span>
			<br/>
<span>It moves, but never moveth on:</span>
			<br/>
<span>And welters like a human thing</span>
			<br/>
<span>Amid the wild waves weltering.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Behind, a buried vale doth sleep,</span>
			<br/>
<span>Far down the torrent cleaves its way:</span>
			<br/>
<span>In front the dumb rock rises steep,</span>
			<br/>
<span>A fretted wall of blue and gray;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Of shooting cliff and crumbled stone</span>
			<br/>
<span>With many a wild weed overgrown:</span>
			<br/>
<span>All else, black water: and afloat,</span>
			<br/>
<span>One rood from shore, that single boat.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Last night the wind was up and strong;</span>
			<br/>
<span>The gray-streak'd waters labor still:</span>
			<br/>
<span>The strong blast brought a pigmy throng</span>
			<br/>
<span>From that mild hollow in the hill;</span>
			<br/>
<span>From those twin brooks, that beached strand</span>
			<br/>
<span>So featly strewn with drifted sand;</span>
			<br/>
<span>From those weird domes of mounded green</span>
			<br/>
<span>That spot the solitary scene.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>This boat they found against the shore:</span>
			<br/>
<span>The glossy rushes nodded by.</span>
			<br/>
<span>One rood from land they push'd, no more;</span>
			<br/>
<span>Then rested, listening silently.</span>
			<br/>
<span>The loud rains lash'd the mountain's crown,</span>
			<br/>
<span>The grating shingle straggled down:</span>
			<br/>
<span>All night they sate; then stole away,</span>
			<br/>
<span>And left it rocking in the bay.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Last night?—I look'd, the sky was clear.</span>
			<br/>
<span>The boat was old, a batter'd boat.</span>
			<br/>
<span>In sooth, it seems a hundred year</span>
			<br/>
<span>Since that strange crew did ride afloat.</span>
			<br/>
<span>The boat hath drifted in the bay—</span>
			<br/>
<span>The oars have moulder'd as they lay—</span>
			<br/>
<span>The rudder swings—yet none doth steer.</span>
			<br/>
<span class="i1">What living hand hath brought it here?</span>

			<p>
				<span>In the cedarn shadow sleeping,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where cool grass and fragrant glooms</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Forth at noon had lured me, creeping</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From your darken’d palace rooms⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I, who in your train at morning</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stroll’d and sang with joyful mind,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heard, in slumber, sounds of warning;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heard the hoarse boughs labour in the wind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who are they, O pensive Graces,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—For I dream’d they wore your forms⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who on shores and sea-wash’d places</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Scoop the shelves and fret the storms?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who, when ships are that way tending,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Troop across the flushing sands,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To all reefs and narrows wending,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With blown tresses, and with beckoning hands?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet I see, the howling levels</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the deep are not your lair;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And your tragic-vaunted revels</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are less lonely than they were.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like those Kings with treasure steering</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From the jewell’d lands of dawn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Troops, with gold and gifts, appearing,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stream all day through your enchanted lawn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And we too, from upland valleys,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where some Muse with half-curved frown</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Leans her ear to your mad sallies</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which the charm’d winds never drown;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By faint music guided, ranging</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The scared glens, we wander’d on,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Left our awful laurels hanging,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And came heap’d with myrtles to your throne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the dragon-warder’d fountains</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where the springs of knowledge are,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From the watchers on the mountains,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the bright and morning star;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We are exiles, we are falling,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We have lost them at your call⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O ye false ones, at your calling</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Seeking ceiled chambers and a palace-hall!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Are the accents of your luring</span>
						<br/>
				<span>More melodious than of yore?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are those frail forms more enduring</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Than the charms Ulysses bore?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That we sought you with rejoicings,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Till at evening we descry</span>
						<br/>
				<span>At a pause of Siren voicings</span>
						<br/>
				<span>These vext branches and this howling sky?⁠ ⁠…</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh, your pardon! The uncouthness</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of that primal age is gone,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the skin of dazzling smoothness</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Screens not now a heart of stone.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Love has flush’d those cruel faces;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And those slacken’d arms forgo</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The delight of death-embraces,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And yon whitening bone-mounds do not grow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah,” you say; “the large appearance</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of man’s labour is but vain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And we plead as staunch adherence</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Due to pleasure as to pain.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pointing to earth’s careworn creatures,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Come,” you murmur with a sigh:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Ah! we own diviner features,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Loftier bearing, and a prouder eye.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Come,” you say, “the hours were dreary;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dull did life in torpor fade;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Time is lame, and we grew weary</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the slumbrous cedarn shade.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Round our hearts with long caresses,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With low sighings, Silence stole,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And her load of steaming tresses</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fell, like Ossa, on the climbing soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Come,” you say, “the soul is fainting</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Till she search and learn her own,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the wisdom of man’s painting</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Leaves her riddle half unknown.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come,” you say, “the brain is seeking,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>While the sovran heart is dead;</span>

						<br/>
				<span>Rarer secrets than the toiling head.</span>
			</p>

				<span>Life dries up, the heart dissembles⁠—</span>

				<span>Only, what we feel, we know.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath your wisdom felt emotions?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Will it weep our burning tears?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath it drunk of our love-potions</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crowning moments with the wealth of years?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—I am dumb. Alas, too soon all</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Man’s grave reasons disappear!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet, I think, at God’s tribunal</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some large answer you shall hear.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, for me, my thoughts are straying</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where at sunrise, through your vines,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On these lawns I saw you playing,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hanging garlands on your odorous pines;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When your showering locks enwound you,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And your heavenly eyes shone through;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When the pine-boughs yielded round you,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And your brows were starr’d with dew;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And immortal forms, to meet you,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down the statued alleys came,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And through golden horns, to greet you,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Blew such music as a God may frame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, I muse! And if the dawning</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Into daylight never grew,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If the glistering wings of morning</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the dry noon shook their dew,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If the fits of joy were longer,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or the day were sooner done,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or, perhaps, if hope were stronger,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No weak nursling of an earthly sun⁠ ⁠…</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pluck, pluck cypress, O pale maidens,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dusk the hall with yew!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For a bound was set to meetings,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the sombre day dragg’d on;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the burst of joyful greetings,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the joyful dawn, were gone.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For the eye grows fill’d with gazing,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And on raptures follow calms;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And those warm locks men were praising,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Droop’d, unbraided, on your listless arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Storms unsmooth’d your folded valleys,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And made all your cedars frown;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Leaves were whirling in the alleys</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which your lovers wander’d down.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Sitting cheerless in your bowers,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The hands propping the sunk head,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still they gall you, the long hours,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the hungry thought, that must be fed!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Is the pleasure that is tasted</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Patient of a long review?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Will the fire joy hath wasted,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mused on, warm the heart anew?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Or, are those old thoughts returning,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Guests the dull sense never knew,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stars, set deep, yet inly burning,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Germs, your untrimm’d passion overgrew?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Once, like us, you took your station</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Watchers for a purer fire;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But you droop’d in expectation,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And you wearied in desire.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When the first rose flush was steeping</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All the frore peak’s awful crown,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shepherds say, they found you sleeping</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In some windless valley, farther down.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then you wept, and slowly raising</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Your dozed eyelids, sought again,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Half in doubt, they say, and gazing</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sadly back, the seats of men;⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Snatch’d a turbid inspiration</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From some transient earthly sun,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And proclaim’d your vain ovation</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For those mimic raptures you had won.⁠ ⁠…</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With a sad, majestic motion,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With a stately, slow surprise,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From their earthward-bound devotion</span>
						<br/>

				<span>Where the looming kine are laid;</span>

				<span>From your dazzled windows streaming,</span>

				<span>Deep and far, a broken gleaming</span>

				<span>Reels and shivers on the ruffled gloom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where I stand, the grass is glowing;</span>

				<span>Have you seen it at the closing?</span>

				<span>Can your eyes, while fools are dozing,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Drop, with mine, adown life’s latter days?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When a dreary dawn is wading</span>

				<span>Through this waste of sunless greens,</span>

			<p>
				<span>All true speech and large avowal</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Come, loose hands! The winged fleetness</span>

				<span>Half their glories to the day;</span>

				<span>Freely did they flash their splendour,</span>

				<span>Freely gave it⁠—but it dies away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>

						<br/>
				<span>Scores of true love knots are breaking</span>
						<br/>
				<span>At divorce which it proclaims.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When the lamps are paled at morning,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heart quits heart and hand quits hand.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cold in that unlovely dawning,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Loveless, rayless, joyless you shall stand!</span>

				<span>Her I loved at eventide?</span>

				<span>Stands, at daybreak, weeping by my side?</span>

						<br/>
				<span>O man, whom Earth, thy long-vext mother, bare</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not without joy⁠—so radiant, so endow’d</span>

				<span>Oh when most self-exalted most alone,</span>

				<span>Thy brother-world stirs at thy feet unknown,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who hath a monarch’s hath no brother’s part;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet doth thine inmost soul with yearning teem.</span>

				<span>Well hath he done who hath seized happiness!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For little do the all-containing hours,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though opulent, freely give.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who, weighing that life well</span>

			<p>
				<span>He does well too, who keeps that clue the mild</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Birth-Goddess and the austere Fates first gave.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For from the day when these</span>

				<span>A country for him, kinsfolk, and a home,</span>

				<span>And, our own place once left,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ignorant where to stand, or whom to avoid,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By city and household group’d, we live; and many shocks</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our order heaven-ordain’d</span>

						<br/>
				<span>And through the void air sang</span>
						<br/>
				<span>At large his enemy’s spear.</span>

			<p>

				<span>Fain would he have recall’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The fraudulent oath which bound</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To a much feebler wight the heroic man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>

				<span>Under the towering Trachis crags,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the Spercheios vale, shaken with groans,</span>

				<span>And the roused Maliac gulph,</span>

				<span>So late, in thy portico?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What youth, Goddess⁠—what guest</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Gods or mortals?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<i>Circe</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</p>

				<span>Hist! he wakes!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I lured him not hither, Ulysses.</span>

				<span>Nay, ask him!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<i>The Youth</i>
					<br/>
				</span>

				<span>Who speaks? Ah, who comes forth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To thy side, Goddess, from within?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How shall I name him?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This spare, dark-featured,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Quick-eyed stranger?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah, and I see too</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His sailor’s bonnet,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His short coat, travel-tarnish’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With one arm bare!⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Art thou not he, whom fame</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This long time rumours</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The favour’d guest of Circe, brought by the waves?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Art thou he, stranger?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The wise Ulysses,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<i>Ulysses</i>

			<p>
				<span>I am Ulysses.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thou, too, sleeper?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thy voice is sweet.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It may be thou hast follow’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through the islands some divine bard,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By age taught many things,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Age and the Muses;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And heard him delighting</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The chiefs and people</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the banquet, and learn’d his songs,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Gods and Heroes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of war and arts,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And peopled cities,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Inland, or built</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By the grey sea.⁠—If so, then hail!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I honour and welcome thee.</span>

				<span>
					<i>The Youth</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Gods are happy.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They turn on all sides</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their shining eyes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And see below them</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The earth and men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They see Tiresias</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sitting, staff in hand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the warm, grassy</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Asopus bank,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His robe drawn over</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His old, sightless head,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Revolving inly</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The doom of Thebes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They see the Centaurs</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the upper glens</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Pelion, in the streams,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where red-berried ashes fringe</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The clear-brown shallow pools,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With streaming flanks, and heads</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rear’d proudly, snuffing</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The mountain wind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They see the Indian</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Drifting, knife in hand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His frail boat moor’d to</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A floating isle thick-matted</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With large-leaved, low-creeping melon-plants,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the dark cucumber.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He reaps, and stows them,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Drifting⁠—drifting;⁠—round him,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Round his green harvest-plot,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Flow the cool lake-waves,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The mountains ring them.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They see the Scythian</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the wide stepp, unharnessing</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His wheel’d house at noon.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He tethers his beast down, and makes his meal⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mares’ milk, and bread</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Baked on the embers;⁠—all around</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The boundless, waving grass-plains stretch, thick-starr’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With saffron and the yellow hollyhock</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And flag-leaved iris-flowers.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sitting in his cart</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He makes his meal; before him, for long miles,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Alive with bright green lizards,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the springing bustard-fowl,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The track, a straight black line,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Furrows the rich soil; here and there</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Clusters of lonely mounds</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Topp’d with rough-hewn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Grey, rain-blear’d statues, overpeer</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The sunny waste.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They see the ferry</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the broad, clay-laden</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lone Chorasmian stream;⁠—thereon,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With snort and strain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Two horses, strongly swimming, tow</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The ferry-boat, with woven ropes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To either bow</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Firm harness’d by the mane; a chief,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With shout and shaken spear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stands at the prow, and guides them; but astern</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The cowering merchants, in long robes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sit pale beside their wealth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of silk-bales and of balsam-drops,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of gold and ivory,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of turquoise-earth and amethyst,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Jasper and chalcedony,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And milk-barr’d onyx-stones.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The loaded boat swings groaning</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the yellow eddies;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Gods behold them.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They see the Heroes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sitting in the dark ship</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the foamless, long-heaving</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Violet sea,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>At sunset nearing</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Happy Islands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These things, Ulysses,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The wise bards also</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Behold and sing.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But oh, what labour!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O prince, what pain!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They too can see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tiresias;⁠—but the Gods,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who give them vision,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Added this law:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That they should bear too</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His groping blindness,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His dark foreboding,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His scorn’d white hairs;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bear Hera’s anger</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through a life lengthen’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To seven ages.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They see the Centaurs</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On Pelion;⁠—then they feel,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They too, the maddening wine</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Swell their large veins to bursting; in wild pain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They feel the biting spears</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the grim Lapithæ, and Theseus, drive,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Drive crashing through their bones; they feel</span>
						<br/>
				<span>High on a jutting rock in the red stream</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Alcmena’s dreadful son</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ply his bow;⁠—such a price</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Gods exact for song:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To become what we sing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They see the Indian</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On his mountain lake; but squalls</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Make their skiff reel, and worms</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the unkind spring have gnawn</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their melon-harvest to the heart.⁠—They see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Scythian; but long frosts</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Parch them in winter-time on the bare stepp,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Till they too fade like grass; they crawl</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like shadows forth in spring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They see the merchants</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the Oxus stream;⁠—but care</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Must visit first them too, and make them pale.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whether, through whirling sand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A cloud of desert robber-horse have burst</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Upon their caravan; or greedy kings,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the wall’d cities the way passes through,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crush’d them with tolls; or fever-airs,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On some great river’s marge,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mown them down, far from home.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They see the Heroes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Near harbour;⁠—but they share</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their lives, and former violent toil in Thebes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Seven-gated Thebes, or Troy;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or where the echoing oars</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Argo first</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Startled the unknown sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The old Silenus</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Came, lolling in the sunshine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From the dewy forest-coverts,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This way, at noon.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sitting by me, while his Fauns</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down at the water-side</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sprinkled and smoothed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His drooping garland,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He told me these things.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But I, Ulysses,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sitting on the warm steps,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Looking over the valley,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All day long, have seen,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Without pain, without labour,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sometimes a wild-hair’d Mænad⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sometimes a Faun with torches⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And sometimes, for a moment,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Passing through the dark stems</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Flowing-robed, the beloved,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The desired, the divine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beloved Iacchus.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, cool night-wind, tremulous stars!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah, glimmering water,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fitful earth-murmur,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dreaming woods!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah, golden-hair’d, strangely smiling Goddess,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thou, proved, much enduring,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wave-toss’d Wanderer!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who can stand still?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ye fade, ye swim, ye waver before me⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The cup again!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Faster, faster,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O Circe, Goddess,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let the wild, thronging train,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The bright procession</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of eddying forms,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sweep through my soul!</span>

				<span>
					<i>Hussein</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O most just Vizier, send away</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The cloth-merchants, and let them be,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Them and their dues, this day! the King</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is ill at ease, and calls for thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<i>The Vizier</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O merchants, tarry yet a day</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here in Bokhara! but at noon,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To-morrow, come, and ye shall pay</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Each fortieth web of cloth to me,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As the law is, and go your way.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O Hussein, lead me to the King!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou teller of sweet tales, thine own,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ferdousi’s, and the others’, lead!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How is it with my lord?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<i>Hussein</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alone,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ever since prayer-time, he doth wait,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O Vizier! without lying down,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the great window of the gate,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Looking into the Registàn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where through the sellers’ booths the slaves</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are this way bringing the dead man.⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O Vizier, here is the King’s door!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<i>The King</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Vizier, I may bury him?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<i>The Vizier</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O King, thou know’st, I have been sick</span>
						<br/>
				<span>These many days, and heard no thing</span>
						<br/>
				<span>(For Allah shut my ears and mind),</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not even what thou dost, O King!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wherefore, that I may counsel thee,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let Hussein, if thou wilt, make haste</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To speak in order what hath chanced.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<i>The King</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Vizier, be it as thou say’st!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<i>Hussein</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Three days since, at the time of prayer</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A certain Moollah, with his robe</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All rent, and dust upon his hair,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Watch’d my lord’s coming forth, and push’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The golden mace-bearers aside,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And fell at the King’s feet, and cried:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Justice, O King, and on myself!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On this great sinner, who did break</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The law, and by the law must die!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Vengeance, O King!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the King spake:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“What fool is this, that hurts our ears</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With folly? or what drunken slave?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My guards, what, prick him with your spears!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Prick me the fellow from the path!”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As the King said, so it was done,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And to the mosque my lord pass’d on.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But on the morrow, when the King</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Went forth again, the holy book</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Carried before him, as is right,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And through the square his way he took;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My man comes running, fleck’d with blood</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From yesterday, and falling down</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cries out most earnestly: “O King,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My lord, O King, do right, I pray!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“How canst thou, ere thou hear, discern</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If I speak folly? but a king,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whether a thing be great or small,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like Allah, hears and judges all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Wherefore hear thou! Thou know’st, how fierce</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In these last days the sun hath burn’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That the green water in the tanks</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is to a putrid puddle turn’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the canal, which from the stream</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Samarcand is brought this way,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wastes, and runs thinner every day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now I at nightfall had gone forth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Alone, and in a darksome place</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Under some mulberry-trees I found</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A little pool; and in short space,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With all the water that was there</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I fill’d my pitcher, and stole home</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Unseen; and having drink to spare,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I hid the can behind the door,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And went up on the roof to sleep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But in the night, which was with wind</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And burning dust, again I creep</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down, having fever, for a drink.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now meanwhile had my brethren found</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The water-pitcher, where it stood</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Behind the door upon the ground,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And call’d my mother; and they all,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As they were thirsty, and the night</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Most sultry, drain’d the pitcher there;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That they sate with it, in my sight,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their lips still wet, when I came down.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now mark! I, being fever’d, sick</span>
						<br/>
				<span>(Most unblest also), at that sight</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Brake forth, and cursed them⁠—dost thou hear?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>One was my mother⁠—⁠Now, do right!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But my lord mused a space, and said:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Send him away, Sirs, and make on!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It is some madman!” the King said.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As the King bade, so was it done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The morrow, at the self-same hour,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the King’s path, behold, the man,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not kneeling, sternly fix’d! he stood</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Right opposite, and thus began,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Frowning grim down: “Thou wicked King,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Most deaf where thou shouldst most give ear!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What, must I howl in the next world,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Because thou wilt not listen here?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What, wilt thou pray, and get thee grace,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And all grace shall to me be grudged?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nay but, I swear, from this thy path</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I will not stir till I be judged!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then they who stood about the King</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Drew close together and conferr’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Till that the King stood forth and said:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Before the priests thou shalt be heard.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the Ulemas were met,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the thing heard, they doubted not;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But sentenced him, as the law is,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To die by stoning on the spot.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the King charged us secretly:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Stoned must he be, the law stands so.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet, if he seek to fly, give way;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hinder him not, but let him go.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So saying, the King took a stone,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And cast it softly;⁠—but the man,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With a great joy upon his face,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Kneel’d down, and cried not, neither ran.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So they, whose lot it was, cast stones,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That they flew thick and bruised him sore.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But he praised Allah with loud voice,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And remain’d kneeling as before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My lord had cover’d up his face;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But when one told him, “He is dead,”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Turning him quickly to go in,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Bring thou to me his corpse,” he said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And truly, while I speak, O King,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I hear the bearers on the stair;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou they straightway bring him in?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Ho! enter ye who tarry there!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<i>The Vizier</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O King, in this I praise thee not!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Now must I call thy grief not wise.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is he thy friend, or of thy blood,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To find such favour in thine eyes?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nay, were he thine own mother’s son,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still, thou art king, and the law stands.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It were not meet the balance swerved,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The sword were broken in thy hands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But being nothing, as he is,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Why for no cause make sad thy face?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lo, I am old! three kings, ere thee,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have I seen reigning in this place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But who, through all this length of time,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Could bear the burden of his years,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If he for strangers pain’d his heart</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not less than those who merit tears?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fathers we <i>must</i> have, wife and child,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And grievous is the grief for these;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This pain alone, which <i>must</i> be borne,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Makes the head white, and bows the knees.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But other loads than this his own</span>
						<br/>
				<span>One man is not well made to bear.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Besides, to each are his own friends,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To mourn with him, and show him care.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Look, this is but one single place,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though it be great; all the earth round,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If a man bear to have it so,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Things which might vex him shall be found.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the Russian frontier, where</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The watchers of two armies stand</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Near one another, many a man,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Seeking a prey unto his hand,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hath snatch’d a little fair-hair’d slave;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They snatch also, towards Mervè,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Shiah dogs, who pasture sheep,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And up from thence to Orgunjè.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And these all, labouring for a lord,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Eat not the fruit of their own hands;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which is the heaviest of all plagues,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To that man’s mind, who understands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The kaffirs also (whom God curse!)</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Vex one another, night and day;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There are the lepers, and all sick;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There are the poor, who faint alway</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All these have sorrow, and keep still,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whilst other men make cheer, and sing.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou have pity on all these?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No, nor on this dead dog, O King!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<i>The King</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Vizier, thou art old, I young!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Clear in these things I cannot see.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My head is burning, and a heat</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is in my skin which angers me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But hear ye this, ye sons of men!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They that bear rule, and are obey’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Unto a rule more strong than theirs</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are in their turn obedient made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In vain therefore, with wistful eyes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gazing up hither, the poor man,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who loiters by the high-heap’d booths,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Below there, in the Registàn,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Says: “Happy he, who lodges there!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With silken raiment, store of rice,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And for this drought, all kinds of fruits,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Grape-syrup, squares of colour’d ice,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With cherries serv’d in drifts of snow.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In vain hath a king power to build</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Houses, arcades, enamell’d mosques;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And to make orchard-closes, fill’d</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With curious fruit-trees brought from far</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With cisterns for the winter-rain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, in the desert, spacious inns</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In divers places⁠—if that pain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is not more lighten’d, which he feels,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If his will be not satisfied;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And that it be not, from all time</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The law is planted, to abide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wast a sinner, thou poor man!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou wast athirst; and didst not see,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That, though we take what we desire,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We must not snatch it eagerly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I have meat and drink at will,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And rooms of treasures, not a few.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But I am sick, nor heed I these;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And what I would, I cannot do.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Even the great honour which I have,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When I am dead, will soon grow still;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So have I neither joy, nor fame.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But what I can do, that I will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I have a fretted brick-work tomb</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Upon a hill on the right hand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hard by a close of apricots,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Upon the road of Samarcand;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thither, O Vizier, will I bear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This man my pity could not save,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, plucking up the marble flags,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There lay his body in my grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bring water, nard, and linen rolls!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wash off all blood, set smooth each limb!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then say: “He was not wholly vile,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Because a king shall bury him.”</span>

				<span>Scarf’d with the cross, who watch’d the miles</span>

				<span>Hath freed from passions, and the state</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We left, just ten years since, you say,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That wayside inn we left to-day.<a id="FNanchor_5_7" name="FNanchor_5_7"/><a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_5_7">[5]</a></span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our jovial host, as forth we fare,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shouts greeting from his easy chair.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>High on a bank our leader stands,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Reviews and ranks his motley bands,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Makes clear our goal to every eye⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The valley’s western boundary.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A gate swings to! our tide hath flow’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Already from the silent road.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The valley-pastures, one by one,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are threaded, quiet in the sun;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And now beyond the rude stone bridge</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Slopes gracious up the western ridge.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its woody border, and the last</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of its dark upland farms is past⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cool farms, with open-lying stores,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Under their burnish’d sycamores;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All past! and through the trees we glide,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Emerging on the green hill-side.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There climbing hangs, a far-seen sign,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our wavering, many-colour’d line;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There winds, upstreaming slowly still</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Over the summit of the hill.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And now, in front, behold outspread</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Those upper regions we must tread!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mild hollows, and clear heathy swells,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The cheerful silence of the fells.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some two hours’ march with serious air,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through the deep noontide heats we fare;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The red-grouse, springing at our sound,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Skims, now and then, the shining ground;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No life, save his and ours, intrudes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Upon these breathless solitudes.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O joy! again the farms appear.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cool shade is there, and rustic cheer;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There springs the brook will guide us down,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bright comrade, to the noisy town.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lingering, we follow down; we gain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The town, the highway, and the plain.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And many a mile of dusty way,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Parch’d and road-worn, we made that day;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, Fausta, I remember well,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That as the balmy darkness fell</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We bathed our hands with speechless glee,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That night, in the wide-glimmering sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Once more we tread this self-same road,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fausta, which ten years since we trod;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Alone we tread it, you and I,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ghosts of that boisterous company.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here, where the brook shines, near its head,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In its clear, shallow, turf-fringed bed;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here, whence the eye first sees, far down,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Capp’d with faint smoke, the noisy town;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here sit we, and again unroll,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though slowly, the familiar whole.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The solemn wastes of heathy hill</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sleep in the July sunshine still;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The self-same shadows now, as then,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Play through this grassy upland glen;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The loose dark stones on the green way</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lie strewn, it seems, where then they lay;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On this mild bank above the stream,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>(You crush them!) the blue gentians gleam.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still this wild brook, the rushes cool,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The sailing foam, the shining pool!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>These are not changed; and we, you say,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are scarce more changed, in truth, than they.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The gipsies, whom we met below,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They, too, have long roam’d to and fro;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They ramble, leaving, where they pass,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their fragments on the cumber’d grass.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And often to some kindly place</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Chance guides the migratory race,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where, though long wanderings intervene,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They recognise a former scene.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The dingy tents are pitch’d; the fires</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Give to the wind their wavering spires;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In dark knots crouch round the wild flame</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their children, as when first they came;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They see their shackled beasts again</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Move, browsing, up the gray-wall’d lane.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Signs are not wanting, which might raise</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The ghost in them of former days⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Signs are not wanting, if they would;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Suggestions to disquietude.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For them, for all, time’s busy touch,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>While it mends little, troubles much.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their joints grow stiffer⁠—but the year</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Runs his old round of dubious cheer;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Chilly they grow⁠—yet winds in March,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still, sharp as ever, freeze and parch;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They must live still⁠—and yet, God knows,</span>
				<span>Crowded and keen the country grows;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It seems as if, in their decay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The law grew stronger every day.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So might they reason, so compare,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fausta, times past with times that are.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But no!⁠—they rubb’d through yesterday</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In their hereditary way,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And they will rub through, if they can,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To-morrow on the self-same plan,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Till death arrive to supersede,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For them, vicissitude and need.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The poet, to whose mighty heart</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heaven doth a quicker pulse impart,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Subdues that energy to scan</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not his own course, but that of man.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though he move mountains, though his day</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Be pass’d on the proud heights of sway,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though he hath loosed a thousand chains,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though he hath borne immortal pains,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Action and suffering though he know⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He hath not lived, if he lives so.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He sees, in some great-historied land,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A ruler of the people stand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sees his strong thought in fiery flood</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Roll through the heaving multitude</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Exults⁠—yet for no moment’s space</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Envies the all-regarded place.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beautiful eyes meet his⁠—and he</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bears to admire uncravingly;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They pass⁠—he, mingled with the crowd,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is in their far-off triumphs proud.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From some high station he looks down,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>At sunset, on a populous town;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Surveys each happy group, which fleets,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Toil ended, through the shining streets,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Each with some errand of its own⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And does not say: <i>I am alone.</i></span>
						<br/>
				<span>He sees the gentle stir of birth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When morning purifies the earth;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He leans upon a gate and sees</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The pastures, and the quiet trees.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Low, woody hill, with gracious bound,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Folds the still valley almost round;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The cuckoo, loud on some high lawn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is answer’d from the depth of dawn;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the hedge straggling to the stream,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pale, dew-drench’d, half-shut roses gleam;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, where the farther side slopes down,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He sees the drowsy new-waked clown</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In his white quaint-embroider’d frock</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Make, whistling, tow’rd his mist-wreathed flock⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Slowly, behind his heavy tread,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The wet, flower’d grass heaves up its head.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lean’d on his gate, he gazes⁠—tears</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are in his eyes, and in his ears</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The murmur of a thousand years.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Before him he sees life unroll,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A placid and continuous whole⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That general life, which does not cease,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose secret is not joy, but peace;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That life, whose dumb wish is not miss’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If birth proceeds, if things subsist;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The life of plants, and stones, and rain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The life he craves⁠—if not in vain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fate gave, what chance shall not control,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His sad lucidity of soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You listen⁠—but that wandering smile,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fausta, betrays you cold the while!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Your eyes pursue the bells of foam</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wash’d, eddying, from this bank, their home.</span>
						<br/>
				<span><i>Those gipsies</i>, so your thoughts I scan,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Are less, the poet more, than man.</i>
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>They feel not, though they move and see;</i>
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Deeper the poet feels; but he</i>
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Breathes, when he will, immortal air,</i>
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Where Orpheus and where Homer are.</i>
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>In the day’s life, whose iron round</i>
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Hems us all in, he is not bound;</i>
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>He leaves his kind, o’erleaps their pen,</i>
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>And flees the common life of men.</i>
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>He escapes thence, but we abide⁠—</i>
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Not deep the poet sees, but wide.</i>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The world in which we live and move</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Outlasts aversion, outlasts love,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Outlasts each effort, interest, hope,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Remorse, grief, joy;⁠—and were the scope</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of these affections wider made,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Man still would see, and see dismay’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beyond his passion’s widest range,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Far regions of eternal change.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nay, and since death, which wipes out man,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Finds him with many an unsolved plan,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With much unknown, and much untried,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wonder not dead, and thirst not dried,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still gazing on the ever full</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Eternal mundane spectacle⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This world in which we draw our breath,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In some sense, Fausta, outlasts death.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Blame thou not, therefore, him who dares</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Judge vain beforehand human cares;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose natural insight can discern</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What through experience others learn;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who needs not love and power, to know</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Love transient, power an unreal show;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who treads at ease life’s uncheer’d ways⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Him blame not, Fausta, rather praise!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rather thyself for some aim pray</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nobler than this, to fill the day;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rather that heart, which burns in thee,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ask, not to amuse, but to set free;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Be passionate hopes not ill resign’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For quiet, and a fearless mind.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And though fate grudge to thee and me</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The poet’s rapt security,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet they, believe me, who await</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No gifts from chance, have conquer’d fate.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They, winning room to see and hear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And to men’s business not too near,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through clouds of individual strife</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Draw homeward to the general life.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like leaves by suns not yet uncurl’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To the wise, foolish; to the world,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Weak;⁠—yet not weak, I might reply,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not foolish, Fausta, in His eye,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To whom each moment in its race,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crowd as we will its neutral space,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is but a quiet watershed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whence, equally, the seas of life and death are fed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Enough, we live!⁠—and if a life,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With large results so little rife,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though bearable, seem hardly worth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This pomp of worlds, this pain of birth;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet, Fausta, the mute turf we tread,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The solemn hills around us spread,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This stream which falls incessantly,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The strange-scrawl’d rocks, the lonely sky,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If I might lend their life a voice,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Seem to bear rather than rejoice.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And even could the intemperate prayer</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Man iterates, while these forbear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For movement, for an ampler sphere,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pierce Fate’s impenetrable ear;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not milder is the general lot</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Because our spirits have forgot,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In action’s dizzying eddy whirl’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The something that infects the world.</span>

				<span>Children dear, was it yesterday</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We heard the sweet bells over the bay?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the caverns where we lay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through the surf and through the swell,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The far-off sound of a silver bell?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where the winds are all asleep;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where the spent lights quiver and gleam,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where the salt weed sways in the stream,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where the sea-beasts, ranged all round,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Feed in the ooze of their pasture-ground;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where the sea-snakes coil and twine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dry their mail and bask in the brine;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where great whales come sailing by,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sail and sail, with unshut eye,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Round the world for ever and aye?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When did music come this way?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Children dear, was it yesterday?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Children dear, was it yesterday</span>
						<br/>
				<span>(Call yet once) that she went away?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Once she sate with you and me,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the youngest sate on her knee.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She comb’d its bright hair, and she tended it well,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When down swung the sound of a far-off bell.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She sigh’d, she look’d up through the clear green sea;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She said: “I must go, for my kinsfolk pray</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the little grey church on the shore to-day.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Twill be Easter-time in the world⁠—ah me!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I lose my poor soul, Merman! here with thee.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I said: “Go up, dear heart, through the waves;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Say thy prayer, and come back to the kind sea-caves!”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She smiled, she went up through the surf in the bay.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Children dear, was it yesterday?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Children dear, were we long alone?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Long prayers,” I said, “in the world they say;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come!” I said: and we rose through the surf in the bay.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We went up the beach, by the sandy down</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where the sea-stocks bloom, to the white-wall’d town;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through the narrow paved streets, where all was still,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To the little grey church on the windy hill.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But we stood without in the cold blowing airs.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We climb’d on the graves, on the stones worn with rains,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dear heart,” I said, “we are long alone;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, ah, she gave me never a look,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For her eyes were seal’d to the holy book!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come away, children, call no more!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come away, come down, call no more!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Down, down, down!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down to the depths of the sea!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She sits at her wheel in the humming town,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Singing most joyfully.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hark what she sings: “O joy, O joy,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For the humming street, and the child with its toy!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For the wheel where I spun,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the blessed light of the sun!”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And so she sings her fill,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Singing most joyfully,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Till the spindle drops from her hand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the whizzing wheel stands still.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She steals to the window, and looks at the sand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And over the sand at the sea;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And her eyes are set in a stare;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And anon there breaks a sigh,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And anon there drops a tear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From a sorrow-clouded eye,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And a heart sorrow-laden,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A long, long sigh;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the gleam of her golden hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Come away, away children;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come children, come down!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The hoarse wind blows coldly;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lights shine in the town.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She will start from her slumber</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When gusts shake the door;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She will hear the winds howling,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Will hear the waves roar.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We shall see, while above us</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The waves roar and whirl,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A ceiling of amber,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A pavement of pearl.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Singing: “Here came a mortal,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But faithless was she!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And alone dwell for ever</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The kings of the sea.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But, children, at midnight,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When soft the winds blow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When clear falls the moonlight,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When spring tides are low;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When sweet airs come seaward</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From heaths starr’d with broom,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And high rocks throw mildly</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the blanch’d sands a gloom;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Up the still, glistening beaches,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Up the creeks we will hie,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Over banks of bright seaweed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The ebb-tide leaves dry.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We will gaze, from the sand-hills,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>At the white, sleeping town;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>At the church on the hill-side⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then come back down.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Singing: “There dwells a loved one,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But cruel is she!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She left lonely for ever</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The kings of the sea.”</span>

						<br/>
				<span>Ere the parting hour go by,</span>

				<span>Paint that lilac kerchief, bound</span>

				<span>Her soft face, her hair around;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tied under the archest chin</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mockery ever ambush’d in.</span>

				<span>Half refused and half resign’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Murmuring: “Art thou still unkind?”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Many a broken promise then</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Was new made⁠—to break again.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ere the parting hour go by,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Quick, thy tablets, Memory!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Paint those eyes, so blue, so kind,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Eager tell-tales of her mind;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Paint, with their impetuous stress</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of inquiring tenderness,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Those frank eyes, where deep I see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>An angelic gravity.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ere the parting hour go by,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Quick, thy tablets, Memory!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What, my friends, these feeble lines</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Show, you say, my love declines?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To paint ill as I have done,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Proves forgetfulness begun?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Time’s gay minions, pleased you see,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Time, your master, governs me;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pleased, you mock the fruitless cry:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Quick, thy tablets, Memory!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, too true! Time’s current strong</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Leaves us fixt to nothing long.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet, if little stays with man,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah, retain we all we can!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If the clear impression dies,</span>

				<span>Ah, the dim remembrance prize!</span>

				<span>They are gone⁠—all is still! Foolish heart, dost thou quiver?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nothing stirs on the lawn but the quick lilac-shade.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Far up shines the house, and beneath flows the river⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here lean, my head, on this cold balustrade!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ere he come⁠—ere the boat by the shining-branch’d border</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of dark elms shoot round, dropping down the proud stream,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let me pause, let me strive, in myself make some order,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ere their boat-music sound, ere their broider’d flags gleam.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Last night we stood earnestly talking together;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She enter’d⁠—that moment his eyes turn’d from me!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fasten’d on her dark hair, and her wreath of white heather⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As yesterday was, so to-morrow will be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their love, let me know, must grow strong and yet stronger,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their passion burn more, ere it ceases to burn.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They must love⁠—while they must! but the hearts that love longer</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are rare⁠—ah! most loves but flow once, and return.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I shall suffer⁠—but they will outlive their affection;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I shall weep⁠—but their love will be cooling; and he,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As he drifts to fatigue, discontent, and dejection,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Will be brought, thou poor heart, how much nearer to thee!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For cold is his eye to mere beauty, who, breaking</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The strong band which passion around him hath furl’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Disenchanted by habit, and newly awaking,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Looks languidly round on a gloom-buried world.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through that gloom he will see but a shadow appearing,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Perceive but a voice as I come to his side⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But deeper their voice grows, and nobler their bearing,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose youth in the fires of anguish hath died.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, to wait!⁠⸺⁠But what notes down the wind, hark! are driving?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Tis he! ’tis their flag, shooting round by the trees!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Let my turn, if it <i>will</i> come, be swift in arriving!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah! hope cannot long lighten torments like these.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hast thou yet dealt him, O life, thy full measure?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>World, have thy children yet bow’d at his knee?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hast thou with myrtle-leaf crown’d him, O pleasure?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Crown, crown him quickly, and leave him for me!</span>

							<br/>
					<span>The gleam-lighted lake;</span>

				<p>
					<span>The poplar avenue was pass’d,</span>
							<br/>

					<span>Up the steep street I hurried fast,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Led by thy taper’s starlike beam.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I came! I saw thee rise!⁠—the blood</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Pour’d flushing to thy languid cheek.</span>

					<span>Lock’d in each other’s arms we stood,</span>

					<span>Thy hand lay languidly in mine,</span>

					<span>Thy cheek was grave, thy speech grew rare.</span>

				<p>
					<span>I blame thee not!⁠—this heart, I know,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To be long loved was never framed;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For something in its depths doth glow</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Too strange, too restless, too untamed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And women⁠—things that live and move</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Mined by the fever of the soul⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>They seek to find in those they love</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Stern strength, and promise of control.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They ask not kindness, gentle ways⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>These they themselves have tried and known;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>They ask a soul which never sways</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With the blind gusts that shake their own.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I too have felt the load I bore</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In a too strong emotion’s sway;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>I too have wish’d, no woman more,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>This starting, feverish heart away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I too have long’d for trenchant force,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And will like a dividing spear;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Have praised the keen, unscrupulous course,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which knows no doubt, which feels no fear.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But in the world I learnt, what there</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thou too wilt surely one day prove,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>That will, that energy, though rare,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Are yet far, far less rare than love.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Go, then!⁠—till time and fate impress</span>
							<br/>
					<span>This truth on thee, be mine no more!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>They will!⁠—for thou, I feel, not less</span>

							<br/>
					<span>Knows that the bent of both our hearts</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Was to be gentle, tranquil, true.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And though we wear out life, alas!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Distracted as a homeless wind,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In beating where we must not pass,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In seeking what we shall not find;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet we shall one day gain, life past,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Clear prospect o’er our being’s whole;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Shall see ourselves, and learn at last</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Our true affinities of soul.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We shall not then deny a course</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To every thought the mass ignore;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>We shall not then call hardness force,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor lightness wisdom any more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then, in the eternal Father’s smile,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Our soothed, encouraged souls will dare</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To seem as free from pride and guile,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>As good, as generous, as they are.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then we shall know our friends!⁠—though much</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Will have been lost⁠—the help in strife,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The thousand sweet, still joys of such</span>
							<br/>
					<span>As hand in hand face earthly life⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Though these be lost, there will be yet</span>
							<br/>
					<span>A sympathy august and pure;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Ennobled by a vast regret,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And by contrition seal’d thrice sure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And we, whose ways were unlike here,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>May then more neighbouring courses ply;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>May to each other be brought near,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And greet across infinity.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How sweet, unreach’d by earthly jars,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>My sister! to maintain with thee</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The hush among the shining stars,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The calm upon the moonlit sea!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How sweet to feel, on the boon air,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>All our unquiet pulses cease!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To feel that nothing can impair</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The gentleness, the thirst for peace⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The gentleness too rudely hurl’d</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On this wild earth of hate and fear;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The thirst for peace a raving world</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Would never let us satiate here.</span>

					<span>We were apart; yet, day by day,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>I bade my heart more constant be.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>I bade it keep the world away,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And grow a home for only thee;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor fear’d but thy love likewise grew,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Like mine, each day, more tried, more true.</span>
				</p>

							<br/>
					<span>The heart can bind itself alone,</span>

							<br/>
					<span>Self-sway’d our feelings ebb and swell⁠—</span>

							<br/>
					<span>Back to thy solitude again!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Back! with the conscious thrill of shame</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which Luna felt, that summer-night,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Flash through her pure immortal frame,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>When she forsook the starry height</span>

					<span>To hang over Endymion’s sleep</span>

					<span>How vain a thing is mortal love,</span>

					<span>But thou hast long had place to prove</span>
							<br/>
					<span>This truth⁠—to prove, and make thine own:</span>

				</hgroup>
				<p>
					<span>Ten years!⁠—and to my waking eye</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Once more the roofs of Berne appear;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The rocky banks, the terrace high,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The stream!⁠—and do I linger here?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The clouds are on the Oberland,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The Jungfrau snows look faint and far;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But bright are those green fields at hand,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And through those fields comes down the Aar,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And from the blue twin-lakes it comes,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Flows by the town, the churchyard fair;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And ’neath the garden-walk it hums,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The house!⁠—and is my Marguerite there?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah, shall I see thee, while a flush</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of startled pleasure floods thy brow,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Quick through the oleanders brush,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And clap thy hands, and cry: <i>’Tis thou!</i></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or hast thou long since wander’d back,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Daughter of France! to France, thy home;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And flitted down the flowery track</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Where feet like thine too lightly come?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Doth riotous laughter now replace</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thy smile; and rouge, with stony glare,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thy cheek’s soft hue; and fluttering lace</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The kerchief that enwound thy hair?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or is it over? art thou dead?⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Dead!⁠—and no warning shiver ran</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Across my heart, to say thy thread</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of life was cut, and closed thy span!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Could from earth’s ways that figure slight</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Be lost, and I not feel ’twas so?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of that fresh voice the gay delight</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Fail from earth’s air, and I not know?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or shall I find thee still, but changed,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But not the Marguerite of thy prime?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With all thy being re-arranged,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Pass’d through the crucible of time;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With spirit vanish’d, beauty waned,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And hardly yet a glance, a tone,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>A gesture⁠—anything⁠—retain’d</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of all that was my Marguerite’s own?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I will not know! For wherefore try,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To things by mortal course that live,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>A shadowy durability,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For which they were not meant, to give?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Like driftwood spars, which meet and pass</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Upon the boundless ocean-plain,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So on the sea of life, alas!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Man meets man⁠—meets, and quits again.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I knew it when my life was young;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>I feel it still, now youth is o’er.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>—The mists are on the mountain hung,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Marguerite I shall see no more.</span>

						<br/>
				<span>Crawls up its rocky stair;</span>

				<span>The autumn storm-winds drive the rack,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Close o’er it, in the air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Behind are the abandon’d baths<a id="FNanchor_26_28" name="FNanchor_26_28"/><a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_26_28">[26]</a></span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mute in their meadows lone;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The leaves are on the valley-paths,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The mists are on the Rhone⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The white mists rolling like a sea!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I hear the torrents roar.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Yes, Obermann, all speaks of thee;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I feel thee near once more!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I turn thy leaves! I feel their breath</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Once more upon me roll;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That air of languor, cold, and death,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which brooded o’er thy soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fly hence, poor wretch, whoe’er thou art,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Condemn’d to cast about,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All shipwreck in thy own weak heart,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For comfort from without!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A fever in these pages burns</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beneath the calm they feign;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A wounded human spirit turns,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here, on its bed of pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, though the virgin mountain-air</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fresh through these pages blows;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though to these leaves the glaciers spare</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The soul of their white snows;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though here a mountain-murmur swells</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of many a dark-bough’d pine;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though, as you read, you hear the bells</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the high-pasturing kine⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet, through the hum of torrent lone,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And brooding mountain-bee,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There sobs I know not what ground-tone</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of human agony.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Is it for this, because the sound</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is fraught too deep with pain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That, Obermann! the world around</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So little loves thy strain?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some secrets may the poet tell,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For the world loves new ways;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To tell too deep ones is not well⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It knows not what he says.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet, of the spirits who have reign’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In this our troubled day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I know but two, who have attain’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Save thee, to see their way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By England’s lakes, in grey old age,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His quiet home one keeps;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And one, the strong much-toiling sage,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In German Weimar sleeps.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Wordsworth’s eyes avert their ken</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From half of human fate;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Goethe’s course few sons of men</span>
						<br/>
				<span>May think to emulate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For he pursued a lonely road,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His eyes on Nature’s plan;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Neither made man too much a God,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor God too much a man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Strong was he, with a spirit free</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From mists, and sane, and clear;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Clearer, how much! than ours⁠—yet we</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have a worse course to steer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For though his manhood bore the blast</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of a tremendous time,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet in a tranquil world was pass’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His tenderer youthful prime.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But we, brought forth and rear’d in hours</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of change, alarm, surprise⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What shelter to grow ripe is ours?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What leisure to grow wise?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Like children bathing on the shore,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Buried a wave beneath,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The second wave succeeds, before</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We have had time to breathe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Too fast we live, too much are tried,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Too harass’d, to attain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wordsworth’s sweet calm, or Goethe’s wide</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And luminous view to gain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then we turn, thou sadder sage,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To thee! we feel thy spell!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—The hopeless tangle of our age,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou too hast scann’d it well!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Immoveable thou sittest, still</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As death, composed to bear!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thy head is clear, thy feeling chill,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And icy thy despair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, as the son of Thetis said,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I hear thee saying now:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Greater by far than thou art dead;</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Strive not! die also thou!</i>
					
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! two desires toss about</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The poet’s feverish blood.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>One drives him to the world without,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And one to solitude.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><i>The glow</i>, he cries, <i>the thrill of life,</i></span>
						<br/>
				<span><i>Where, where do these abound</i>?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not in the world, not in the strife</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of men, shall they be found.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He who hath watch’d, not shared, the strife,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Knows how the day hath gone.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He only lives with the world’s life,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who hath renounced his own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To thee we come, then! Clouds are roll’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where thou, O seer! art set;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thy realm of thought is drear and cold⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The world is colder yet!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thou hast pleasures, too, to share</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With those who come to thee⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Balms floating on thy mountain-air,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And healing sights to see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How often, where the slopes are green</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On Jaman, hast thou sate</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By some high chalet-door, and seen</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The summer-day grow late;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And darkness steal o’er the wet grass</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With the pale crocus starr’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And reach that glimmering sheet of glass</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beneath the piny sward,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lake Leman’s waters, far below!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And watch’d the rosy light</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fade from the distant peaks of snow;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And on the air of night</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Heard accents of the eternal tongue</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through the pine branches play⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Listen’d, and felt thyself grow young!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Listen’d and wept⁠—⁠Away!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Away the dreams that but deceive</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thou, sad guide, adieu!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I go, fate drives me; but I leave</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Half of my life with you.</span>
			</p>
			<p>

				<span>The mules, I think, will not be here this hour;<br/></span>
				<span>They feel the cool wet turf under their feet<br/></span>
				<span>By the stream-side, after the dusty lanes<br/></span>
				<span>In which they have toil’d all night from Catana,<br/></span>
				<span>And scarcely will they budge a yard. O Pan,<br/></span>
				<span>How gracious is the mountain at this hour!<br/></span>
				<span>A thousand times have I been here alone,<br/></span>
				<span>Or with the revellers from the mountain-towns,<br/></span>
				<span>But never on so fair a morn;⁠—the sun<br/></span>
				<span>Is shining on the brilliant mountain-crests,<br/></span>
				<span>And on the highest pines; but farther down,<br/></span>
				<span>Here in the valley, is in shade; the sward<br/></span>
				<span>Is dark, and on the stream the mist still hangs;<br/></span>
				<span>One sees one’s footprints crush’d in the wet grass,<br/></span>
				<span>One’s breath curls in the air; and on these pines<br/></span>
				<span>That climb from the stream’s edge, the long grey tufts,<br/></span>
				<span>Which the goats love, are jewell’d thick with dew.<br/></span>
				<span>Here will I stay till the slow litter comes.<br/></span>
				<span>I have my harp too⁠—that is well.⁠—Apollo!<br/></span>
				<span>What mortal could be sick or sorry here?<br/></span>
				<span>I know not in what mind Empedocles,<br/></span>
				<span>Whose mules I follow’d, may be coming up,<br/></span>
				<span>But if, as most men say, he is half mad<br/></span>
				<span>With exile, and with brooding on his wrongs,<br/></span>
				<span>Pausanias, his sage friend, who mounts with him,<br/></span>
				<span>Could scarce have lighted on a lovelier cure.<br/></span>
				<span>The mules must be below, far down. I hear<br/></span>
				<span>Their tinkling bells, mix’d with the song of birds,<br/></span>

				<span>With thy head full of wine, and thy hair crown’d,<br/></span>
				<span>Touching thy harp as the whim came on thee,<br/></span>
				<span>And praised and spoil’d by master and by guests<br/></span>

				<span>As I was lifting my soil’d garland off,<br/></span>
				<span>I saw the mules and litter in the court,<br/></span>
				<span>And in the litter sate Empedocles;<br/></span>
				<span>Thou, too, wast with him. Straightway I sped home;<br/></span>
				<span>I saddled my white mule, and all night long<br/></span>
				<span>Through the cool lovely country follow’d you,<br/></span>
				<span>Pass’d you a little since as morning dawn’d,<br/></span>

				<span>No⁠—and yet<br/></span>

				<span>And still, I know not how, he draws me to him,<br/></span>
				<span>And I could watch him with his proud sad face,<br/></span>
				<span>His flowing locks and gold-encircled brow<br/></span>
				<span>And kingly gait, for ever; such a spell<br/></span>
				<span>In his severe looks, such a majesty<br/></span>
				<span>As drew of old the people after him,<br/></span>
				<span>In Agrigentum and Olympia,<br/></span>
				<span>When his star reign’d, before his banishment,<br/></span>
				<span>Is potent still on me in his decline.<br/></span>
				<span>But oh! Pausanias, he is changed of late;<br/></span>
				<span>There is a settled trouble in his air<br/></span>
				<span>Admits no momentary brightening now,<br/></span>
				<span>And when he comes among his friends at feasts,<br/></span>
				<span>’Tis as an orphan among prosperous boys.<br/></span>
				<span>Thou know’st of old he loved this harp of mine,<br/></span>
				<span>When first he sojourn’d with Peisianax;<br/></span>
				<span>He is now always moody, and I fear him;<br/></span>

				<span>Thou wast a kind child ever!<br/></span>
				<span>He loves thee, but he must not see thee now.<br/></span>
				<span>Thou hast indeed a rare touch on thy harp,<br/></span>
				<span>He loves that in thee, too;⁠—there was a time<br/></span>
				<span>(But that is pass’d), he would have paid thy strain<br/></span>
				<span>With music to have drawn the stars from heaven.<br/></span>
				<span>He hath his harp and laurel with him still,<br/></span>
				<span>But he has laid the use of music by,<br/></span>
				<span>And all which might relax his settled gloom.<br/></span>
				<span>Yet thou may’st try thy playing, if thou wilt⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>But thou must keep unseen; follow us on,<br/></span>
				<span>But at a distance! in these solitudes,<br/></span>
				<span>In this clear mountain-air, a voice will rise,<br/></span>
				<span>Though from afar, distinctly; it may soothe him.<br/></span>
				<span>Play when we halt, and, when the evening comes<br/></span>
				<span>And I must leave him (for his pleasure is<br/></span>
				<span>To be left musing these soft nights alone<br/></span>
				<span>In the high unfrequented mountain-spots),<br/></span>
				<span>Then watch him, for he ranges swift and far,<br/></span>
				<span>Sometimes to Etna’s top, and to the cone;<br/></span>
				<span>But hide thee in the rocks a great way down,<br/></span>
				<span>And try thy noblest strains, my Callicles,<br/></span>
				<span>With the sweet night to help thy harmony!<br/></span>

				<span>Thirty long days in a cold trance of death,<br/></span>

				<span>Thou art too young to note it, but his power<br/></span>
				<span>Swells with the swelling evil of this time,<br/></span>
				<span>And holds men mute to see where it will rise.<br/></span>

				<span>Chain madmen by the music of his lyre,<br/></span>
				<span>Cleanse to sweet airs the breath of poisonous streams,<br/></span>
				<span>And in the mountain-chinks inter the winds.<br/></span>
				<span>This he could do of old; but now, since all<br/></span>
				<span>Clouds and grows daily worse in Sicily,<br/></span>
				<span>Since broils tear us in twain, since this new swarm<br/></span>
				<span>Of sophists has got empire in our schools<br/></span>
				<span>Where he was paramount, since he is banish’d<br/></span>
				<span>And lives a lonely man in triple gloom⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>He grasps the very reins of life and death.<br/></span>
				<span>I ask’d him of Pantheia yesterday,<br/></span>
				<span>When we were gather’d with Peisianax,<br/></span>
				<span>And he made answer, I should come at night<br/></span>
				<span>On Etna here, and be alone with him,<br/></span>
				<span>And he would tell me, as his old, tried friend,<br/></span>

				<span>Bah! Thou a doctor! Thou art superstitious.<br/></span>
				<span>Simple Pausanias, ’twas no miracle!<br/></span>
				<span>Pantheia, for I know her kinsmen well,<br/></span>
				<span>Was subject to these trances from a girl.<br/></span>
				<span>Empedocles would say so, did he deign;<br/></span>
				<span>But he still lets the people, whom he scorns,<br/></span>
				<span>Gape and cry <i>wizard</i> at him, if they list.<br/></span>
				<span>But thou, thou art no company for him!<br/></span>
				<span>Thou art as cross, as sour’d as himself!<br/></span>
				<span>Thou hast some wrong from thine own citizens,<br/></span>
				<span>And then thy friend is banish’d, and on that,<br/></span>
				<span>Straightway thou fallest to arraign the times,<br/></span>
				<span>As if the sky was impious not to fall.<br/></span>
				<span>The sophists are no enemies of his;<br/></span>
				<span>I hear, Gorgias, their chief, speaks nobly of him,<br/></span>
				<span>As of his gifted master, and once friend.<br/></span>
				<span>He is too scornful, too high-wrought, too bitter.<br/></span>
				<span>’Tis not the times, ’tis not the sophists vex him;<br/></span>
				<span>There is some root of suffering in himself,<br/></span>
				<span>Some secret and unfollow’d vein of woe,<br/></span>
				<span>Which makes the time look black and sad to him.<br/></span>
				<span>Pester him not in this his sombre mood<br/></span>
				<span>With questionings about an idle tale,<br/></span>
				<span>But lead him through the lovely mountain-paths,<br/></span>
				<span>And keep his mind from preying on itself,<br/></span>
				<span>And talk to him of things at hand and common,<br/></span>
				<span>Not miracles! thou art a learned man,<br/></span>
				<span>But credulous of fables as a girl.<br/></span>

			<div>
				<span>And thou, a boy whose tongue outruns his knowledge,<br/></span>
				<span>And on whose lightness blame is thrown away.<br/></span>
				<span>Enough of this! I see the litter wind<br/></span>
				<span>Up by the torrent-side, under the pines.<br/></span>
				<span>I must rejoin Empedocles. Do thou<br/></span>
				<span>Crouch in the brushwood till the mules have pass’d;<br/></span>
				<span>Then play thy kind part well. Farewell till night!<br/></span>

					<i>Pausanias</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>The noon is hot. When we have cross’d the stream,<br/></span>
				<span>We shall have left the woody tract, and come<br/></span>
				<span>Upon the open shoulder of the hill.<br/></span>
				<span>See how the giant spires of yellow bloom<br/></span>
				<span>Of the sun-loving gentian, in the heat,<br/></span>
				<span>Are shining on those naked slopes like flame!<br/></span>
				<span>Let us rest here; and now, Empedocles,<br/></span>
				<span>Pantheia’s history!<br/></span>
				<span>[<i>A harp-note below is heard.</i><br/></span>

				<span>
					<i>Empedocles</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>Hark! what sound was that<br/></span>
				<span>Rose from below? If it were possible,<br/></span>
				<span>And we were not so far from human haunt,<br/></span>
				<span>I should have said that some one touch’d a harp<br/></span>
				<span>Hark! there again!<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>
					<i>Pausanias</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>’Tis the boy Callicles,<br/></span>
				<span>The sweetest harp-player in Catana.<br/></span>
				<span>He is for ever coming on these hills,<br/></span>
				<span>In summer, to all country-festivals,<br/></span>
				<span>With a gay revelling band; he breaks from them<br/></span>
				<span>Sometimes, and wanders far among the glens.<br/></span>
				<span>But heed him not, he will not mount to us;<br/></span>
				<span>I spoke with him this morning. Once more, therefore,<br/></span>
				<span>Instruct me of Pantheia’s story, Master,<br/></span>
				<span>As I have pray’d thee.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>
					<i>Empedocles</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>That? and to what end?<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>
					<i>Pausanias</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>It is enough that all men speak of it.<br/></span>
				<span>But I will also say, that when the Gods<br/></span>
				<span>Visit us as they do with sign and plague,<br/></span>
				<span>To know those spells of thine which stay their hand<br/></span>
				<span>Were to live free from terror.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>
					<i>Empedocles</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>Spells? Mistrust them!<br/></span>
				<span>Mind is the spell which governs earth and heaven.<br/></span>
				<span>Man has a mind with which to plan his safety;<br/></span>
				<span>Know that, and help thyself!<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>
					<i>Pausanias</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>But thine own words?<br/></span>
				<span>“The wit and counsel of man was never clear,<br/></span>
				<span>Troubles confound the little wit he has.”<br/></span>
				<span>Mind is a light which the Gods mock us with,<br/></span>
				<span>To lead those false who trust it.<br/></span>
				<span>[<i>The harp sounds again.</i><br/></span>

				<span>The track winds down to the clear stream,<br/></span>
				<span>To cross the sparkling shallows; there<br/></span>
				<span>The cattle love to gather, on their way<br/></span>
				<span>To the high mountain-pastures, and to stay,<br/></span>
				<span>Till the rough cow-herds drive them past,<br/></span>
				<span>Knee-deep in the cool ford; for ’tis the last<br/></span>
				<span>Of all the woody, high, well-water’d dells<br/></span>
				<span>On Etna; and the beam<br/></span>
				<span>Of noon is broken there by chestnut-boughs<br/></span>
				<span>Down its steep verdant sides; the air<br/></span>
				<span>Is freshen’d by the leaping stream, which throws<br/></span>
				<span>Eternal showers of spray on the moss’d roots<br/></span>
				<span>Of trees, and veins of turf, and long dark shoots<br/></span>
				<span>Of ivy-plants, and fragrant hanging bells<br/></span>
				<span>Of hyacinths, and on late anemonies,<br/></span>
				<span>That muffle its wet banks; but glade,<br/></span>
				<span>And stream, and sward, and chestnut-trees,<br/></span>
				<span>End here; Etna beyond, in the broad glare<br/></span>

				<span>In such a glen, on such a day,<br/></span>
				<span>On Pelion, on the grassy ground,<br/></span>
				<span>Chiron, the aged Centaur lay,<br/></span>
				<span>The young Achilles standing by.<br/></span>
				<span>The Centaur taught him to explore<br/></span>
				<span>The mountains; where the glens are dry<br/></span>
				<span>And the tired Centaurs come to rest,<br/></span>
				<span>And where the soaking springs abound<br/></span>
				<span>And the straight ashes grow for spears,<br/></span>
				<span>And where the hill-goats come to feed,<br/></span>
				<span>And the sea-eagles build their nest.<br/></span>
				<span>He show’d him Phthia far away,<br/></span>
				<span>And said: O boy, I taught this lore<br/></span>
				<span>To Peleus, in long distant years!<br/></span>
				<span>He told him of the Gods, the stars,<br/></span>
				<span>The tides;⁠—and then of mortal wars,<br/></span>
				<span>And of the life which heroes lead<br/></span>
				<span>Before they reach the Elysian place<br/></span>

				<span>The Gods laugh in their sleeve<br/></span>
				<span>To watch man doubt and fear,<br/></span>
				<span>Who knows not what to believe<br/></span>
				<span>Since he sees nothing clear,<br/></span>
				<span>And dares stamp nothing false where he finds nothing sure.<br/></span>

			<div>
				<span>Nor is the thirst to blame.<br/></span>
				<span>Man errs not that he deems<br/></span>

				<span>What were the wise man’s plan?⁠—<br/></span>

				<span>All things the world which fill<br/></span>
				<span>Of but one stuff are spun,<br/></span>
				<span>That we who rail are still,<br/></span>
				<span>With what we rail at, one;<br/></span>

				<span>Fain would do all things well, but sometimes fails in strength.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>And patiently exact<br/></span>
				<span>This universal God<br/></span>
				<span>Alike to any act<br/></span>
				<span>Proceeds at any nod,<br/></span>
				<span>And quietly declaims the cursings of himself.<br/></span>

				<span>Harsh Gods and hostile Fates<br/></span>
				<span>Are dreams! this only <i>is</i>⁠—<br/></span>

				<span>Stern Powers who make their care<br/></span>
				<span>To embitter human life, malignant Deities;<br/></span>

				<span>My laurel bough!<br/></span>
				<span>Scornful Apollo’s ensign, lie thou there!<br/></span>

				<span>Of the rocks of Parnassus,<br/></span>
				<span>Of the rocks of Delphi,<br/></span>
				<span>Of the moonlit peaks, and the caves.<br/></span>
				<span>Thou guardest them, Apollo!<br/></span>
				<span>Over the grave of the slain Pytho,<br/></span>
				<span>Though young, intolerably severe!<br/></span>
				<span>Thou keepest aloof the profane,<br/></span>
				<span>But the solitude oppresses thy votary!<br/></span>
				<span>The jars of men reach him not in thy valley⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>But can life reach him?<br/></span>
				<span>Thou fencest him from the multitude⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Who will fence him from himself?<br/></span>
				<span>He hears nothing but the cry of the torrents,<br/></span>
				<span>And the beating of his own heart.<br/></span>
				<span>The air is thin, the veins swell,<br/></span>
				<span>The temples tighten and throb there⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Air! air!<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>Take thy bough, set me free from my solitude;<br/></span>
				<span>I have been enough alone!<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span>Where shall thy votary fly then? back to men?⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>But they will gladly welcome him once more,<br/></span>
				<span>And help him to unbend his too tense thought,<br/></span>
				<span>And rid him of the presence of himself,<br/></span>
				<span>And keep their friendly chatter at his ear,<br/></span>
				<span>And haunt him, till the absence from himself,<br/></span>
				<span>That other torment, grow unbearable;<br/></span>
				<span>And he will fly to solitude again,<br/></span>
				<span>And he will find its air too keen for him,<br/></span>
				<span>And so change back; and many thousand times<br/></span>
				<span>Be miserably bandied to and fro<br/></span>
				<span>Like a sea-wave, betwixt the world and thee,<br/></span>
				<span>Thou young, implacable God! and only death<br/></span>
				<span>Can cut his oscillations short, and so<br/></span>
				<span>Bring him to poise. There is no other way.<br/></span>
				<span>And yet what days were those, Parmenides!<br/></span>
				<span>When we were young, when we could number friends<br/></span>
				<span>In all the Italian cities like ourselves,<br/></span>
				<span>When with elated hearts we join’d your train.<br/></span>

				<span>Then we could still enjoy, then neither thought<br/></span>
				<span>Nor outward things were closed and dead to us;<br/></span>
				<span>But we received the shock of mighty thoughts<br/></span>
				<span>On simple minds with a pure natural joy;<br/></span>
				<span>And if the sacred load oppress’d our brain,<br/></span>
				<span>We had the power to feel the pressure eased,<br/></span>
				<span>The brow unbound, the thoughts flow free again,<br/></span>
				<span>In the delightful commerce of the world.<br/></span>
				<span>We had not lost our balance then, nor grown<br/></span>
				<span>Thought’s slaves, and dead to every natural joy.<br/></span>
				<span>The smallest thing could give us pleasure then⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>The sports of the country-people,<br/></span>

				<span>From that on which his exiled age is thrown⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Whose mind was fed on other food, was train’d<br/></span>
				<span>By other rules than are in vogue to-day⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Whose habit of thought is fix’d, who will not change,<br/></span>
				<span>But, in a world he loves not, must subsist<br/></span>
				<span>In ceaseless opposition, be the guard<br/></span>
				<span>Of his own breast, fetter’d to what he guards,<br/></span>

					<span>Though the locks are yet brown on his noble head,<br/></span>
					<span>Propt on pillows in his bed,<br/></span>
					<span>Gazing seaward for the light<br/></span>
					<span>Of some ship that fights the gale<br/></span>
					<span>On this wild December night?<br/></span>
					<span>Over the sick man’s feet is spread<br/></span>
					<span>A dark green forest-dress;<br/></span>
					<span>A gold harp leans against the bed,<br/></span>
					<span>Ruddy in the fire’s light.<br/></span>
					<span>I know him by his harp of gold,<br/></span>
					<span>Famous in Arthur’s court of old;<br/></span>
					<span>I know him by his forest-dress⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>The peerless hunter, harper, knight,<br/></span>
					<span>Tristram of Lyoness.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What Lady is this, whose silk attire<br/></span>
					<span>Gleams so rich in the light of the fire?<br/></span>
					<span>The ringlets on her shoulders lying<br/></span>
					<span>In their flitting lustre vying<br/></span>
					<span>With the clasp of burnish’d gold<br/></span>
					<span>Which her heavy robe doth hold.<br/></span>
					<span>Her looks are mild, her fingers slight<br/></span>
					<span>As the driven snow are white;<br/></span>
					<span>But her cheeks are sunk and pale.<br/></span>
					<span>Is it that the bleak sea-gale<br/></span>
					<span>Beating from the Atlantic sea<br/></span>
					<span>On this coast of Brittany,<br/></span>
					<span>Nips too keenly the sweet flower?<br/></span>
					<span>Is it that a deep fatigue<br/></span>
					<span>Hath come on her, a chilly fear,<br/></span>
					<span>Passing all her youthful hour<br/></span>
					<span>Spinning with her maidens here,<br/></span>
					<span>Listlessly through the window-bars<br/></span>
					<span>Gazing seawards many a league,<br/></span>
					<span>From her lonely shore-built tower,<br/></span>
					<span>While the knights are at the wars?<br/></span>
					<span>Or, perhaps, has her young heart<br/></span>
					<span>Felt already some deeper smart,<br/></span>
					<span>Of those that in secret the heart-strings rive,<br/></span>
					<span>Leaving her sunk and pale, though fair?<br/></span>
					<span>Who is this snowdrop by the sea?⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>I know her by her mildness rare,<br/></span>
					<span>Her snow-white hands, her golden hair;<br/></span>
					<span>I know her by her rich silk dress,<br/></span>
					<span>And her fragile loveliness⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>The sweetest Christian soul alive,<br/></span>
					<span>Iseult of Brittany.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Iseult of Brittany?⁠—but where<br/></span>
					<span>Is that other Iseult fair,<br/></span>
					<span>That proud, first Iseult, Cornwall’s queen?<br/></span>
					<span>She, whom Tristram’s ship of yore<br/></span>
					<span>From Ireland to Cornwall bore,<br/></span>
					<span>To Tyntagel, to the side<br/></span>
					<span>Of King Marc, to be his bride?<br/></span>
					<span>She who, as they voyaged, quaff’d<br/></span>
					<span>With Tristram that spiced magic draught,<br/></span>
					<span>Which since then for ever rolls<br/></span>
					<span>Through their blood, and binds their souls,<br/></span>
					<span>Working love, but working teen?⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>There were two Iseults who did sway<br/></span>
					<span>Each her hour of Tristram’s day;<br/></span>
					<span>But one possess’d his waning time,<br/></span>
					<span>The other his resplendent prime.<br/></span>
					<span>Behold her here, the patient flower,<br/></span>
					<span>Who possess’d his darker hour!<br/></span>
					<span>Iseult of the Snow-White Hand<br/></span>
					<span>Watches pale by Tristram’s bed.<br/></span>
					<span>She is here who had his gloom,<br/></span>
					<span>Where art thou who hadst his bloom?<br/></span>
					<span>One such kiss as those of yore<br/></span>
					<span>Might thy dying knight restore!<br/></span>
					<span>Does the love-draught work no more?<br/></span>
					<span>Art thou cold, or false, or dead,<br/></span>
					<span>Iseult of Ireland?<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Loud howls the wind, sharp patters the rain,<br/></span>
					<span>And the knight sinks back on his pillows again.<br/></span>
					<span>He is weak with fever and pain,<br/></span>
					<span>And his spirit is not clear.<br/></span>
					<span>Hark! he mutters in his sleep,<br/></span>
					<span>As he wanders far from here,<br/></span>
					<span>Changes place and time of year,<br/></span>
					<span>And his closéd eye doth sweep<br/></span>
					<span>O’er some fair unwintry sea,<br/></span>
					<span>Not this fierce Atlantic deep,<br/></span>
					<span>While he mutters brokenly:⁠—<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<i>Tristram</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The calm sea shines, loose hang the vessel’s sails;<br/></span>
					<span>Before us are the sweet green fields of Wales,<br/></span>
					<span>And overhead the cloudless sky of May.⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>
						<i>“Ah, would I were in those green fields at play,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>Not pent on ship-board this delicious day!</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>Tristram, I pray thee, of thy courtesy,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>Reach me my golden phial stands by thee,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span><i>But pledge me in it first for courtesy</i>.⁠—”<br/></span>
					<span>Ha! dost thou start? are thy lips blanch’d like mine?<br/></span>
					<span>Child, ’tis no true draught this, ’tis poison’d wine!<br/></span>
					<span>Iseult!⁠ ⁠…<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah, sweet angels, let him dream!<br/></span>
					<span>Keep his eyelids! let him seem<br/></span>
					<span>Not this fever-wasted wight<br/></span>
					<span>Thinn’d and paled before his time,<br/></span>
					<span>But the brilliant youthful knight<br/></span>
					<span>In the glory of his prime,<br/></span>
					<span>Sitting in the gilded barge,<br/></span>
					<span>At thy side, thou lovely charge,<br/></span>
					<span>Bending gaily o’er thy hand,<br/></span>
					<span>Iseult of Ireland!<br/></span>
					<span>And she too, that princess fair,<br/></span>
					<span>If her bloom be now less rare,<br/></span>
					<span>Let her have her youth again⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Let her be as she was then!<br/></span>
					<span>Let her have her proud dark eyes,<br/></span>
					<span>And her petulant quick replies⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Let her sweep her dazzling hand<br/></span>
					<span>With its gesture of command,<br/></span>
					<span>And shake back her raven hair<br/></span>
					<span>With the old imperious air!<br/></span>
					<span>As of old, so let her be,<br/></span>
					<span>That first Iseult, princess bright,<br/></span>
					<span>Chatting with her youthful knight<br/></span>
					<span>As he steers her o’er the sea,<br/></span>
					<span>Quitting at her father’s will<br/></span>
					<span>The green isle where she was bred,<br/></span>
					<span>And her bower in Ireland,<br/></span>
					<span>For the surge-beat Cornish strand;<br/></span>
					<span>Where the prince whom she must wed<br/></span>
					<span>Dwells on loud Tyntagel’s hill,<br/></span>
					<span>High above the sounding sea.<br/></span>
					<span>And that potion rare her mother<br/></span>
					<span>Gave her, that her future lord,<br/></span>
					<span>Gave her, that King Marc and she,<br/></span>
					<span>Might drink it on their marriage-day,<br/></span>
					<span>And for ever love each other⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Let her, as she sits on board,<br/></span>
					<span>Ah, sweet saints, unwittingly!<br/></span>
					<span>See it shine, and take it up,<br/></span>
					<span>And to Tristram laughing say:<br/></span>
					<span>“Sir Tristram, of thy courtesy,<br/></span>
					<span>Pledge me in my golden cup!”<br/></span>
					<span>Let them drink it⁠—let their hands<br/></span>
					<span>Tremble, and their cheeks be flame,<br/></span>
					<span>As they feel the fatal bands<br/></span>
					<span>Of a love they dare not name,<br/></span>
					<span>With a wild delicious pain,<br/></span>
					<span>Twine about their hearts again!<br/></span>
					<span>Let the early summer be<br/></span>
					<span>Once more round them, and the sea<br/></span>
					<span>Blue, and o’er its mirror kind<br/></span>
					<span>Let the breath of the May-wind,<br/></span>
					<span>Wandering through their drooping sails,<br/></span>
					<span>Die on the green fields of Wales!<br/></span>
					<span>Let a dream like this restore<br/></span>
					<span>What his eye must see no more!<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<i>Tristram</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Chill blows the wind, the pleasaunce-walks are drear⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Madcap, what jest was this, to meet me here?<br/></span>
					<span>Were feet like those made for so wild a way?<br/></span>
					<span>The southern winter-parlour, by my fay,<br/></span>
					<span>Had been the likeliest trysting-place to-day!<br/></span>
					<span>“<i>Tristram!⁠—nay, nay⁠—thou must not take my hand!⁠—</i><br/></span>
					<span>
						<i>Tristram!⁠—sweet love!⁠—we are betray’d⁠—out-plann’d.</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>Fly⁠—save thyself⁠—save me!⁠—I dare not stay.”⁠—</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>One last kiss first!⁠—”<i>’Tis vain⁠—to horse⁠—away!</i>”<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah! sweet saints, his dream doth move<br/></span>
					<span>Faster surely than it should,<br/></span>
					<span>From the fever in his blood!<br/></span>
					<span>All the spring-time of his love<br/></span>
					<span>Is already gone and past,<br/></span>
					<span>And instead thereof is seen<br/></span>
					<span>Its winter, which endureth still⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Tyntagel on its surge-beat hill,<br/></span>
					<span>The pleasaunce-walks, the weeping queen,<br/></span>
					<span>The flying leaves, the straining blast,<br/></span>
					<span>And that long, wild kiss⁠—their last.<br/></span>
					<span>And this rough December-night,<br/></span>
					<span>And his burning fever-pain,<br/></span>
					<span>Mingle with his hurrying dream,<br/></span>
					<span>Till they rule it, till he seem<br/></span>
					<span>The press’d fugitive again,<br/></span>
					<span>The love-desperate banish’d knight<br/></span>
					<span>With a fire in his brain<br/></span>
					<span>Flying o’er the stormy main.<br/></span>
					<span>—Whither does he wander now?<br/></span>
					<span>Haply in his dreams the wind<br/></span>
					<span>Wafts him here, and lets him find<br/></span>
					<span>The lovely orphan child again<br/></span>
					<span>In her castle by the coast;<br/></span>
					<span>The youngest, fairest chatelaine,<br/></span>
					<span>Whom this realm of France can boast,<br/></span>
					<span>Our snowdrop by the Atlantic sea,<br/></span>
					<span>Iseult of Brittany.<br/></span>
					<span>And⁠—for through the haggard air,<br/></span>
					<span>The stain’d arms, the matted hair<br/></span>
					<span>Of that stranger-knight ill-starr’d,<br/></span>
					<span>There gleam’d something, which recall’d<br/></span>
					<span>The Tristram who in better days<br/></span>
					<span>Was Launcelot’s guest at Joyous Gard⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Welcomed here, and here install’d,<br/></span>
					<span>Tended of his fever here,<br/></span>
					<span>Haply he seems again to move<br/></span>
					<span>His young guardian’s heart with love;<br/></span>
					<span>In his exiled loneliness,<br/></span>
					<span>In his stately, deep distress,<br/></span>
					<span>Without a word, without a tear.<br/></span>
					<span>—Ah! ’tis well he should retrace<br/></span>
					<span>His tranquil life in this lone place;<br/></span>
					<span>His gentle bearing at the side<br/></span>
					<span>Of his timid youthful bride;<br/></span>
					<span>His long rambles by the shore<br/></span>
					<span>On winter-evenings, when the roar<br/></span>
					<span>Of the near waves came, sadly grand,<br/></span>
					<span>Through the dark, up the drown’d sand,<br/></span>
					<span>Or his endless reveries<br/></span>
					<span>In the woods, where the gleams play<br/></span>
					<span>On the grass under the trees,<br/></span>
					<span>Passing the long summer’s day<br/></span>
					<span>Idle as a mossy stone<br/></span>
					<span>In the forest-depths alone,<br/></span>
					<span>The chase neglected, and his hound<br/></span>
					<span>Couch’d beside him on the ground.<br/></span>
					<span>—Ah! what trouble’s on his brow?<br/></span>
					<span>Hither let him wander now;<br/></span>
					<span>Hither, to the quiet hours<br/></span>
					<span>Pass’d among these heaths of ours<br/></span>
					<span>By the grey Atlantic sea;<br/></span>
					<span>Hours, if not of ecstasy,<br/></span>
					<span>From violent anguish surely free!<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<i>Tristram</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All red with blood the whirling river flows,<br/></span>
					<span>The wide plain rings, the dazed air throbs with blows.<br/></span>
					<span>Upon us are the chivalry of Rome⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Their spears are down, their steeds are bathed in foam.<br/></span>
					<span>“Up, Tristram, up,” men cry, “thou moonstruck knight!<br/></span>
					<span>What foul fiend rides thee? On into the fight!”<br/></span>
					<span>—Above the din her voice is in my ears;<br/></span>
					<span>I see her form glide through the crossing spears.⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Iseult!⁠ ⁠…<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah! he wanders forth again;<br/></span>
					<span>We cannot keep him; now, as then,<br/></span>
					<span>There’s a secret in his breast<br/></span>
					<span>Which will never let him rest.<br/></span>
					<span>These musing fits in the green wood<br/></span>
					<span>They cloud the brain, they dull the blood!<br/></span>
					<span>—His sword is sharp, his horse is good;<br/></span>
					<span>Beyond the mountains will he see<br/></span>
					<span>The famous towns of Italy,<br/></span>
					<span>And label with the blessed sign<br/></span>
					<span>The heathen Saxons on the Rhine.<br/></span>
					<span>At Arthur’s side he fights once more<br/></span>
					<span>With the Roman Emperor.<br/></span>
					<span>There’s many a gay knight where he goes<br/></span>
					<span>Will help him to forget his care;<br/></span>
					<span>The march, the leaguer, Heaven’s blithe air,<br/></span>
					<span>The neighing steeds, the ringing blows⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Sick pining comes not where these are.<br/></span>
					<span>Ah! what boots it, that the jest<br/></span>
					<span>Lightens every other brow,<br/></span>
					<span>What, that every other breast<br/></span>
					<span>Dances as the trumpets blow,<br/></span>
					<span>If one’s own heart beats not light<br/></span>
					<span>On the waves of the toss’d fight,<br/></span>
					<span>If oneself cannot get free<br/></span>
					<span>From the clog of misery?<br/></span>
					<span>Thy lovely youthful wife grows pale<br/></span>
					<span>Watching by the salt sea-tide<br/></span>
					<span>With her children at her side<br/></span>
					<span>For the gleam of thy white sail.<br/></span>
					<span>Home, Tristram, to thy halls again!<br/></span>
					<span>To our lonely sea complain,<br/></span>
					<span>To our forests tell thy pain!<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<i>Tristram</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All round the forest sweeps off, black in shade,<br/></span>
					<span>But it is moonlight in the open glade;<br/></span>
					<span>And in the bottom of the glade shine clear<br/></span>
					<span>The forest-chapel and the fountain near.<br/></span>
					<span>—I think, I have a fever in my blood;<br/></span>
					<span>Come, let me leave the shadow of this wood,<br/></span>
					<span>Ride down, and bathe my hot brow in the flood.<br/></span>
					<span>—Mild shines the cold spring in the moon’s clear light;<br/></span>
					<span>God! ’tis <i>her</i> face plays in the waters bright.<br/></span>
					<span>“Fair love,” she says, “canst thou forget so soon,<br/></span>
					<span>At this soft hour, under this sweet moon?”⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Iseult!⁠ ⁠…<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah, poor soul! if this be so,<br/></span>
					<span>Only death can balm thy woe.<br/></span>
					<span>The solitudes of the green wood<br/></span>
					<span>Had no medicine for thy mood;<br/></span>
					<span>The rushing battle clear’d thy blood<br/></span>
					<span>As little as did solitude.<br/></span>
					<span>—Ah! his eyelids slowly break<br/></span>
					<span>Their hot seals, and let him wake;<br/></span>
					<span>What new change shall we now see?<br/></span>
					<span>A happier? Worse it cannot be.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<i>Tristram</i>
						<br/>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Is my page here? Come, turn me to the fire!<br/></span>
					<span>Upon the window-panes the moon shines bright;<br/></span>
					<span>The wind is down⁠—but she’ll not come to-night.<br/></span>
					<span>Ah no! she is asleep in Cornwall now,<br/></span>
					<span>Far hence; her dreams are fair⁠—smooth is her brow<br/></span>
					<span>Of me she recks not, nor my vain desire.<br/></span>
					<span>—I have had dreams, I have had dreams, my page,<br/></span>
					<span>Would take a score years from a strong man’s age;<br/></span>
					<span>And with a blood like mine, will leave, I fear,<br/></span>
					<span>Scant leisure for a second messenger.<br/></span>
					<span>—My princess, art thou there? Sweet, do not wait!<br/></span>
					<span>To bed, and sleep! my fever is gone by;<br/></span>
					<span>To-night my page shall keep me company.<br/></span>
					<span>Where do the children sleep? kiss them for me!<br/></span>
					<span>Poor child, thou art almost as pale as I;<br/></span>
					<span>This comes of nursing long and watching late.<br/></span>
					<span>To bed⁠—good night!<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She left the gleam-lit fireplace,<br/></span>
					<span>She came to the bed-side;<br/></span>
					<span>She took his hands in hers⁠—her tears<br/></span>
					<span>Down on his wasted fingers rain’d.<br/></span>
					<span>She raised her eyes upon his face⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Not with a look of wounded pride,<br/></span>
					<span>A look as if the heart complained⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Her look was like a sad embrace;<br/></span>
					<span>The gaze of one who can divine<br/></span>
					<span>A grief, and sympathise.<br/></span>
					<span>Sweet flower! thy children’s eyes<br/></span>
					<span>Are not more innocent than thine.<br/></span>
					<span>But they sleep in shelter’d rest,<br/></span>
					<span>Like helpless birds in the warm nest,<br/></span>
					<span>On the castle’s southern side;<br/></span>
					<span>Where feebly comes the mournful roar<br/></span>
					<span>Of buffeting wind and surging tide<br/></span>
					<span>Through many a room and corridor.<br/></span>
					<span>—Full on their window the moon’s ray<br/></span>
					<span>Makes their chamber as bright as day.<br/></span>
					<span>It shines upon the blank white walls,<br/></span>
					<span>And on the snowy pillow falls,<br/></span>
					<span>And on two angel-heads doth play<br/></span>
					<span>Turn’d to each other⁠—the eyes closed,<br/></span>
					<span>The lashes on the cheeks reposed.<br/></span>
					<span>Round each sweet brow the cap close-set<br/></span>
					<span>Hardly lets peep the golden hair;<br/></span>
					<span>Through the soft-open’d lips the air<br/></span>
					<span>Scarcely moves the coverlet.<br/></span>
					<span>One little wandering arm is thrown<br/></span>
					<span>At random on the counterpane,<br/></span>
					<span>And often the fingers close in haste<br/></span>
					<span>As if their baby-owner chased<br/></span>
					<span>The butterflies again.<br/></span>
					<span>This stir they have, and this alone;<br/></span>
					<span>But else they are so still!<br/></span>
					<span>—Ah, tired madcaps! you lie still;<br/></span>
					<span>But were you at the window now,<br/></span>
					<span>To look forth on the fairy sight<br/></span>
					<span>Of your illumined haunts by night,<br/></span>
					<span>To see the park-glades where you play<br/></span>
					<span>Far lovelier than they are by day,<br/></span>
					<span>To see the sparkle on the eaves,<br/></span>
					<span>And upon every giant-bough<br/></span>
					<span>Of those old oaks, whose wet red leaves<br/></span>
					<span>Are jewell’d with bright drops of rain⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>How would your voices run again!<br/></span>
					<span>And far beyond the sparkling trees<br/></span>
					<span>Of the castle-park one sees<br/></span>
					<span>The bare heaths spreading, clear as day,<br/></span>
					<span>Moor behind moor, far, far away,<br/></span>
					<span>Into the heart of Brittany.<br/></span>
					<span>And here and there, lock’d by the land,<br/></span>
					<span>Long inlets of smooth glittering sea,<br/></span>
					<span>And many a stretch of watery sand<br/></span>
					<span>All shining in the white moon-beams⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>But you see fairer in your dreams!<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What voices are these on the clear night-air?<br/></span>
					<span>What lights in the court⁠—what steps on the stair?<br/></span>

					<span>Raise the light, my page! that I may see her.⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Thou art come at last, then, haughty Queen!<br/></span>

				<p>
					<span>Blame me not, poor sufferer! that I tarried;<br/></span>
					<span>Bound I was, I could not break the band.<br/></span>
					<span>Chide not with the past, but feel the present!<br/></span>

					<span>Fear not now that men should tax thine honour!<br/></span>

					<span>Tristram, ah, for love of Heaven, speak kindly!<br/></span>
					<span>What, I hear these bitter words from thee?<br/></span>
					<span>Sick with grief I am, and faint with travel⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Take my hand⁠—dear Tristram, look on me!<br/></span>

				<p>
					<span>I forgot, thou comest from thy voyage⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Yes, the spray is on thy cloak and hair.<br/></span>
					<span>But thy dark eyes are not dimm’d, proud Iseult!<br/></span>
					<span>And thy beauty never was more fair.<br/></span>

						<i>Iseult</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah, harsh flatterer! let alone my beauty!<br/></span>
					<span>I, like thee, have left my youth afar.<br/></span>
					<span>Take my hand, and touch these wasted fingers⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>See my cheek and lips, how white they are!<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>

						<i>Tristram</i>
						<br/>

				<p>
					<span>Thou art paler⁠—but thy sweet charm, Iseult!<br/></span>
					<span>Would not fade with the dull years away.<br/></span>
					<span>Ah, how fair thou standest in the moonlight!<br/></span>
					<span>I forgive thee, Iseult!⁠—thou wilt stay?<br/></span>

						<i>Iseult</i>

				<p>
					<span>Fear me not, I will be always with thee;<br/></span>
					<span>I will watch thee, tend thee, soothe thy pain;<br/></span>
					<span>Sing thee tales of true, long-parted lovers,<br/></span>
					<span>Join’d at evening of their days again.<br/></span>
				</p>

						<i>Tristram</i>

				<p>
					<span>No, thou shalt not speak! I should be finding<br/></span>
					<span>Something alter’d in thy courtly tone.<br/></span>
					<span>Sit⁠—sit by me! I will think, we’ve lived so<br/></span>
					<span>In the green wood, all our lives, alone.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<i>Iseult</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Alter’d, Tristram? Not in courts, believe me,<br/></span>
					<span>Love like mine is alter’d in the breast;<br/></span>
					<span>Courtly life is light and cannot reach it⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Ah! it lives, because so deep-suppress’d!<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What, thou think’st men speak in courtly chambers<br/></span>
					<span>Words by which the wretched are consoled?<br/></span>
					<span>What, thou think’st this aching brow was cooler,<br/></span>
					<span>Circled, Tristram, by a band of gold?<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Royal state with Marc, my deep-wrong’d husband⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>That was bliss to make my sorrows flee!<br/></span>
					<span>Silken courtiers whispering honied nothings⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Those were friends to make me false to thee!<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah, on which, if both our lots were balanced,<br/></span>
					<span>Was indeed the heaviest burden thrown⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Thee, a pining exile in thy forest,<br/></span>
					<span>Me, a smiling queen upon my throne?<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Vain and strange debate, where both have suffer’d<br/></span>
					<span>Both have pass’d a youth consumed and sad,<br/></span>
					<span>Both have brought their anxious day to evening,<br/></span>
					<span>And have now short space for being glad!<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Join’d we are henceforth; nor will thy people,<br/></span>
					<span>Nor thy younger Iseult take it ill,<br/></span>
					<span>That a former rival shares her office,<br/></span>
					<span>When she sees her humbled, pale, and still.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I, a faded watcher by thy pillow,<br/></span>
					<span>I, a statue on thy chapel-floor,<br/></span>
					<span>Pour’d in prayer before the Virgin-Mother,<br/></span>
					<span>Rouse no anger, make no rivals more.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She will cry: “Is this the foe I dreaded?<br/></span>
					<span>This his idol? this that royal bride?<br/></span>
					<span>Ah, an hour of health would purge his eyesight!<br/></span>
					<span>Stay, pale queen! for ever by my side.”<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hush, no words! that smile, I see, forgives me.<br/></span>
					<span>I am now thy nurse, I bid thee sleep.<br/></span>
					<span>Close thine eyes⁠—this flooding moonlight blinds them!⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Nay, all’s well again! thou must not weep.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<i>Tristram</i>

					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I am happy! yet I feel, there’s something<br/></span>
					<span>Swells my heart, and takes my breath away.<br/></span>
					<span>Through a mist I see thee; near⁠—come nearer!<br/></span>
					<span>Bend⁠—bend down!⁠—I yet have much to say.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<i>Iseult</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Heaven! his head sinks back upon the pillow⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Tristram! Tristram! let thy heart not fail!<br/></span>
					<span>Call on God and on the holy angels!<br/></span>
					<span>What, love, courage!⁠—Christ! he is so pale.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<i>Tristram</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hush, ’tis vain, I feel my end approaching!<br/></span>
					<span>This is what my mother said should be,<br/></span>
					<span>When the fierce pains took her in the forest,<br/></span>
					<span>The deep draughts of death, in bearing me.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Son,” she said, “thy name shall be of sorrow;<br/></span>
					<span>Tristram art thou call’d for my death’s sake.”<br/></span>
					<span>So she said, and died in the drear forest.<br/></span>
					<span>Grief since then his home with me doth make.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I am dying.⁠—Start not, nor look wildly!<br/></span>
					<span>Me, thy living friend, thou canst not save.<br/></span>
					<span>But, since living we were ununited,<br/></span>
					<span>Go not far, O Iseult! from my grave.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Close mine eyes, then seek the princess Iseult;<br/></span>
					<span>Speak her fair, she is of royal blood!<br/></span>
					<span>Say, I will’d so, that thou stay beside me⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>She will grant it; she is kind and good.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now to sail the seas of death I leave thee⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>One last kiss upon the living shore!<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<i>Iseult</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tristram!⁠—Tristram!⁠—stay⁠—receive me with thee!<br/></span>
					<span>Iseult leaves thee, Tristram! never more.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You see them clear⁠—the moon shines bright.<br/></span>
					<span>Slow, slow and softly, where she stood,<br/></span>
					<span>She sinks upon the ground;⁠—her hood<br/></span>
					<span>Had fallen back; her arms outspread<br/></span>
					<span>Still hold her lover’s hand; her head<br/></span>
					<span>Is bow’d, half-buried, on the bed.<br/></span>
					<span>O’er the blanch’d sheet her raven hair<br/></span>
					<span>Lies in disorder’d streams; and there,<br/></span>
					<span>Strung like white stars, the pearls still are,<br/></span>
					<span>And the golden bracelets, heavy and rare,<br/></span>
					<span>Flash on her white arms still.<br/></span>
					<span>The very same which yesternight<br/></span>
					<span>Flash’d in the silver sconces’ light,<br/></span>
					<span>When the feast was gay and the laughter loud<br/></span>
					<span>In Tyntagel’s palace proud.<br/></span>
					<span>But then they deck’d a restless ghost<br/></span>
					<span>With hot-flush’d cheeks and brilliant eyes,<br/></span>
					<span>And quivering lips on which the tide<br/></span>
					<span>Of courtly speech abruptly died,<br/></span>
					<span>And a glance which over the crowded floor,<br/></span>
					<span>The dancers, and the festive host,<br/></span>
					<span>Flew ever to the door.<br/></span>
					<span>That the knights eyed her in surprise,<br/></span>
					<span>And the dames whispered scoffingly:<br/></span>
					<span>“Her moods, good lack, they pass like showers!<br/></span>
					<span>But yesternight and she would be<br/></span>
					<span>As pale and still as wither’d flowers,<br/></span>
					<span>And now to-night she laughs and speaks<br/></span>
					<span>And has a colour in her cheeks;<br/></span>
					<span>Christ keep us from such fantasy!”⁠—<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yes, now the longing is o’erpast,<br/></span>
					<span>Which, dogg’d by fear and fought by shame,<br/></span>
					<span>Shook her weak bosom day and night,<br/></span>
					<span>Consumed her beauty like a flame,<br/></span>
					<span>And dimm’d it like the desert-blast.<br/></span>
					<span>And though the bed-clothes hide her face,<br/></span>
					<span>Yet were it lifted to the light,<br/></span>
					<span>The sweet expression of her brow<br/></span>
					<span>Would charm the gazer, till his thought<br/></span>
					<span>Erased the ravages of time,<br/></span>
					<span>Fill’d up the hollow cheek, and brought<br/></span>
					<span>A freshness back as of her prime⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>So healing is her quiet now.<br/></span>
					<span>So perfectly the lines express<br/></span>
					<span>A tranquil, settled loveliness,<br/></span>
					<span>Her younger rival’s purest grace.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The air of the December-night<br/></span>
					<span>Steals coldly around the chamber bright,<br/></span>
					<span>Where those lifeless lovers be;<br/></span>
					<span>Swinging with it, in the light<br/></span>
					<span>Flaps the ghostlike tapestry.<br/></span>
					<span>And on the arras wrought you see<br/></span>
					<span>A stately Huntsman, clad in green,<br/></span>
					<span>And round him a fresh forest-scene.<br/></span>
					<span>On that clear forest-knoll he stays,<br/></span>
					<span>With his pack round him, and delays.<br/></span>
					<span>He stares and stares, with troubled face,<br/></span>
					<span>At this huge, gleam-lit fireplace,<br/></span>
					<span>At that bright, iron-figured door,<br/></span>
					<span>And those blown rushes on the floor.<br/></span>
					<span>He gazes down into the room<br/></span>
					<span>With heated cheeks and flurried air,<br/></span>
					<span>And to himself he seems to say:<br/></span>
					<span>“<i>What place is this, and who are they?</i><br/></span>
					<span>
						<i>Who is that kneeling Lady fair?</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>And on his pillows that pale Knight</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>Who seems of marble on a tomb?</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>How comes it here, this chamber bright,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>Through whose mullion’d windows clear</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>The castle-court all wet with rain,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>The drawbridge and the moat appear,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>And then the beach, and, mark’d with spray,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>The sunken reefs, and far away</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>The unquiet bright Atlantic plain?</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>—What, has some glamour made me sleep,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>And sent me with my dogs to sweep,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>By night, with boisterous bugle-peal,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>Through some old, sea-side, knightly hall,</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>Not in the free green wood at all?</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>That Knight’s asleep, and at her prayer</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span>
						<i>That Lady by the bed doth kneel⁠—</i>
						<br/>
					</span>
					<span><i>Then hush, thou boisterous bugle-peal!</i>”<br/></span>
					<span>—The wild boar rustles in his lair;<br/></span>
					<span>The fierce hounds snuff the tainted air;<br/></span>
					<span>But lord and hounds keep rooted there.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Cheer, cheer thy dogs into the brake,<br/></span>
					<span>O Hunter! and without a fear<br/></span>
					<span>Thy golden-tassell’d bugle blow,<br/></span>
					<span>And through the glades thy pastime take⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>For thou wilt rouse no sleepers here!<br/></span>
					<span>For these thou seest are unmoved;<br/></span>
					<span>Cold, cold as those who lived and loved<br/></span>
					<span>A thousand years ago.<br/></span>

				</hgroup>
				<p>
					<span>A year had flown, and o’er the sea away,<br/></span>
					<span>In Cornwall, Tristram and Queen Iseult lay;<br/></span>
					<span>In King Marc’s chapel, in Tyntagel old⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>There in a ship they bore those lovers cold.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The young surviving Iseult, one bright day,<br/></span>
					<span>Had wander’d forth. Her children were at play<br/></span>
					<span>In a green circular hollow in the heath<br/></span>
					<span>Which borders the sea-shore⁠—a country path<br/></span>
					<span>Creeps over it from the till’d fields behind.<br/></span>
					<span>The hollow’s grassy banks are soft-inclined,<br/></span>
					<span>And to one standing on them, far and near<br/></span>
					<span>The lone unbroken view spreads bright and clear<br/></span>
					<span>Over the waste. This cirque of open ground<br/></span>
					<span>Is light and green; the heather, which all round<br/></span>
					<span>Creeps thickly, grows not here; but the pale grass<br/></span>
					<span>Is strewn with rocks, and many a shiver’d mass<br/></span>
					<span>Of vein’d white-gleaming quartz, and here and there<br/></span>
					<span>Dotted with holly-trees and juniper.<br/></span>
					<span>In the smooth centre of the opening stood<br/></span>
					<span>Three hollies side by side, and made a screen,<br/></span>
					<span>Warm with the winter-sun, of burnish’d green<br/></span>
					<span>With scarlet berries gemm’d, the fell-fare’s food.<br/></span>
					<span>Under the glittering hollies Iseult stands,<br/></span>
					<span>Watching her children play; their little hands<br/></span>
					<span>Are busy gathering spars of quartz, and streams<br/></span>
					<span>Of stagshorn for their hats; anon, with screams<br/></span>
					<span>Of mad delight they drop their spoils, and bound<br/></span>
					<span>Among the holly-clumps and broken ground,<br/></span>
					<span>Racing full speed, and startling in their rush<br/></span>
					<span>The fell-fares and the speckled missel-thrush<br/></span>
					<span>Out of their glossy coverts;⁠—but when now<br/></span>
					<span>Their cheeks were flush’d, and over each hot brow,<br/></span>
					<span>Under the feather’d hats of the sweet pair,<br/></span>
					<span>In blinding masses shower’d the golden hair⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Then Iseult call’d them to her, and the three<br/></span>
					<span>Cluster’d under the holly-screen, and she<br/></span>
					<span>Told them an old-world Breton history.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Warm in their mantles wrapt the three stood there,<br/></span>
					<span>Under the hollies, in the clear still air⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Mantles with those rich furs deep glistering<br/></span>
					<span>Which Venice ships do from swart Egypt bring.<br/></span>
					<span>Long they stay’d still⁠—then, pacing at their ease,<br/></span>
					<span>Moved up and down under the glossy trees.<br/></span>
					<span>But still, as they pursued their warm dry road,<br/></span>
					<span>From Iseult’s lips the unbroken story flow’d,<br/></span>
					<span>And still the children listen’d, their blue eyes<br/></span>
					<span>Fix’d on their mother’s face in wide surprise;<br/></span>
					<span>Nor did their looks stray once to the sea-side,<br/></span>
					<span>Nor to the brown heaths round them, bright and wide,<br/></span>
					<span>Nor to the snow, which, though ‘t was all away<br/></span>
					<span>From the open heath, still by the hedgerows lay,<br/></span>
					<span>Nor to the shining sea-fowl, that with screams<br/></span>
					<span>Bore up from where the bright Atlantic gleams,<br/></span>
					<span>Swooping to landward; nor to where, quite clear,<br/></span>
					<span>The fell-fares settled on the thickets near.<br/></span>
					<span>And they would still have listen’d, till dark night<br/></span>
					<span>Came keen and chill down on the heather bright;<br/></span>
					<span>But, when the red glow on the sea grew cold,<br/></span>
					<span>And the grey turrets of the castle old<br/></span>
					<span>Look’d sternly through the frosty evening-air,<br/></span>
					<span>Then Iseult took by the hand those children fair,<br/></span>
					<span>And brought her tale to an end, and found the path,<br/></span>
					<span>And led them home over the darkening heath.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And is she happy? Does she see unmoved<br/></span>
					<span>The days in which she might have lived and loved<br/></span>
					<span>Slip without bringing bliss slowly away,<br/></span>
					<span>One after one, to-morrow like to-day?<br/></span>
					<span>Joy has not found her yet, nor ever will⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Is it this thought which makes her mien so still,<br/></span>
					<span>Her features so fatigued, her eyes, though sweet,<br/></span>
					<span>So sunk, so rarely lifted save to meet<br/></span>
					<span>Her children’s? She moves slow; her voice alone<br/></span>
					<span>Hath yet an infantine and silver tone,<br/></span>
					<span>But even that comes languidly; in truth,<br/></span>
					<span>She seems one dying in a mask of youth.<br/></span>
					<span>And now she will go home, and softly lay<br/></span>
					<span>Her laughing children in their beds, and play<br/></span>
					<span>Awhile with them before they sleep; and then<br/></span>
					<span>She’ll light her silver lamp, which fishermen<br/></span>
					<span>Dragging their nets through the rough waves, afar,<br/></span>
					<span>Along this iron coast, know like a star,<br/></span>
					<span>And take her broidery-frame, and there she’ll sit<br/></span>
					<span>Hour after hour, her gold curls sweeping it;<br/></span>
					<span>Lifting her soft-bent head only to mind<br/></span>
					<span>Her children, or to listen to the wind.<br/></span>
					<span>And when the clock peals midnight, she will move<br/></span>
					<span>Her work away, and let her fingers rove<br/></span>
					<span>Across the shaggy brows of Tristram’s hound<br/></span>
					<span>Who lies, guarding her feet, along the ground;<br/></span>
					<span>Or else she will fall musing, her blue eyes<br/></span>
					<span>Fixt, her slight hands clasp’d on her lap; then rise,<br/></span>
					<span>And at her prie-dieu kneel, until she have told<br/></span>
					<span>Her rosary-beads of ebony tipp’d with gold,<br/></span>
					<span>Then to her soft sleep⁠—and to-morrow ‘ll be<br/></span>
					<span>To-day’s exact repeated effigy.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yes, it is lonely for her in her hall.<br/></span>
					<span>The children, and the grey-hair’d seneschal,<br/></span>
					<span>Her women, and Sir Tristram’s aged hound,<br/></span>
					<span>Are there the sole companions to be found.<br/></span>
					<span>But these she loves; and noisier life than this<br/></span>
					<span>She would find ill to bear, weak as she is.<br/></span>
					<span>She has her children, too, and night and day<br/></span>
					<span>Is with them; and the wide heaths where they play,<br/></span>
					<span>The hollies, and the cliff, and the sea-shore,<br/></span>
					<span>The sand, the sea-birds, and the distant sails,<br/></span>
					<span>These are to her dear as to them; the tales<br/></span>
					<span>With which this day the children she beguiled<br/></span>
					<span>She gleaned from Breton grandames, when a child,<br/></span>
					<span>In every hut along this sea-coast wild.<br/></span>
					<span>She herself loves them still, and, when they are told,<br/></span>
					<span>Can forget all to hear them, as of old.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dear saints, it is not sorrow, as I hear,<br/></span>
					<span>Not suffering, which shuts up eye and ear<br/></span>
					<span>To all that has delighted them before,<br/></span>
					<span>And lets us be what we were once no more.<br/></span>
					<span>No, we may suffer deeply, yet retain<br/></span>
					<span>Power to be moved and soothed, for all our pain,<br/></span>
					<span>By what of old pleased us, and will again.<br/></span>
					<span>No, ’tis the gradual furnace of the world,<br/></span>
					<span>In whose hot air our spirits are upcurl’d<br/></span>
					<span>Until they crumble, or else grow like steel⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Which kills in us the bloom, the youth, the spring⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Which leaves the fierce necessity to feel,<br/></span>
					<span>But takes away the power⁠—this can avail,<br/></span>
					<span>By drying up our joy in everything,<br/></span>
					<span>To make our former pleasures all seem stale.<br/></span>
					<span>This, or some tyrannous single thought, some fit<br/></span>
					<span>Of passion, which subdues our souls to it,<br/></span>
					<span>Till for its sake alone we live and move⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>Call it ambition, or remorse, or love⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>This too can change us wholly, and make seem<br/></span>
					<span>All which we did before, shadow and dream.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And yet, I swear, it angers me to see<br/></span>
					<span>How this fool passion gulls men potently;<br/></span>
					<span>Being, in truth, but a diseased unrest,<br/></span>
					<span>And an unnatural overheat at best.<br/></span>
					<span>How they are full of languor and distress<br/></span>
					<span>Not having it; which when they do possess,<br/></span>
					<span>They straightway are burnt up with fume and care,<br/></span>
					<span>And spend their lives in posting here and there<br/></span>
					<span>Where this plague drives them; and have little ease,<br/></span>
					<span>Are furious with themselves, and hard to please.<br/></span>
					<span>Like that bold Cæsar, the famed Roman wight,<br/></span>
					<span>Who wept at reading of a Grecian knight<br/></span>
					<span>Who made a name at younger years than he;<br/></span>
					<span>Or that renown’d mirror of chivalry,<br/></span>
					<span>Prince Alexander, Philip’s peerless son,<br/></span>
					<span>Who carried the great war from Macedon<br/></span>
					<span>Into the Soudan’s realm, and thundered on<br/></span>
					<span>To die at thirty-five in Babylon.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What tale did Iseult to the children say,<br/></span>
					<span>Under the hollies, that bright winter’s day?<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>She told them of the fairy-haunted land<br/></span>
					<span>Away the other side of Brittany,<br/></span>
					<span>Beyond the heaths, edged by the lonely sea;<br/></span>
					<span>Of the deep forest-glades of Broce-liande,<br/></span>
					<span>Through whose green boughs the golden sunshine creeps,<br/></span>
					<span>Where Merlin by the enchanted thorn-tree sleeps.<br/></span>
					<span>For here he came with the fay Vivian,<br/></span>
					<span>One April, when the warm days first began.<br/></span>
					<span>He was on foot, and that false fay, his friend,<br/></span>
					<span>On her white palfrey; here he met his end,<br/></span>
					<span>In these lone sylvan glades, that April-day.<br/></span>
					<span>This tale of Merlin and the lovely fay<br/></span>
					<span>Was the one Iseult chose, and she brought clear<br/></span>
					<span>Before the children’s fancy him and her.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Blowing between the stems, the forest-air<br/></span>
					<span>Had loosen’d the brown locks of Vivian’s hair,<br/></span>
					<span>Which play’d on her flush’d cheek, and her blue eyes<br/></span>
					<span>Sparkled with mocking glee and exercise.<br/></span>
					<span>Her palfrey’s flanks were mired and bathed in sweat,<br/></span>
					<span>For they had travell’d far and not stopp’d yet.<br/></span>
					<span>A brier in that tangled wilderness<br/></span>
					<span>Had scored her white right hand, which she allows<br/></span>
					<span>To rest ungloved on her green riding-dress;<br/></span>
					<span>The other warded off the drooping boughs.<br/></span>
					<span>But still she chatted on, with her blue eyes<br/></span>
					<span>Fix’d full on Merlin’s face, her stately prize.<br/></span>
					<span>Her ‘haviour had the morning’s fresh clear grace,<br/></span>
					<span>The spirit of the woods was in her face.<br/></span>
					<span>She look’d so witching fair, that learned wight<br/></span>
					<span>Forgot his craft, and his best wits took flight;<br/></span>
					<span>And he grew fond, and eager to obey<br/></span>
					<span>His mistress, use her empire as she may.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They came to where the brushwood ceased, and day<br/></span>
					<span>Peer’d ’twixt the stems; and the ground broke away,<br/></span>
					<span>In a sloped sward down to a brawling brook;<br/></span>
					<span>And up as high as where they stood to look<br/></span>
					<span>On the brook’s farther side was clear, but then<br/></span>
					<span>The underwood and trees began again.<br/></span>
					<span>This open glen was studded thick with thorns<br/></span>
					<span>Then white with blossom; and you saw the horns,<br/></span>
					<span>Through last year’s fern, of the shy fallow-deer<br/></span>
					<span>Who come at noon down to the water here.<br/></span>
					<span>You saw the bright-eyed squirrels dart along<br/></span>
					<span>Under the thorns on the green sward; and strong<br/></span>
					<span>The blackbird whistled from the dingles near,<br/></span>
					<span>And the weird chipping of the woodpecker<br/></span>
					<span>Rang lonelily and sharp; the sky was fair,<br/></span>
					<span>And a fresh breath of spring stirr’d everywhere.<br/></span>
					<span>Merlin and Vivian stopp’d on the slope’s brow,<br/></span>
					<span>To gaze on the light sea of leaf and bough<br/></span>
					<span>Which glistering plays all round them, lone and mild,<br/></span>
					<span>As if to itself the quiet forest smiled.<br/></span>
					<span>Upon the brow-top grew a thorn, and here<br/></span>
					<span>The grass was dry and moss’d, and you saw clear<br/></span>
					<span>Across the hollow; white anemonies<br/></span>
					<span>Starr’d the cool turf, and clumps of primroses<br/></span>
					<span>Ran out from the dark underwood behind.<br/></span>
					<span>No fairer resting-place a man could find.<br/></span>
					<span>“Here let us halt,” said Merlin then; and she<br/></span>
					<span>Nodded, and tied her palfrey to a tree.<br/></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They sate them down together, and a sleep<br/></span>
					<span>Fell upon Merlin, more like death, so deep.<br/></span>
					<span>Her finger on her lips, then Vivian rose,<br/></span>
					<span>And from her brown-lock’d head the wimple throws,<br/></span>
					<span>And takes it in her hand, and waves it over<br/></span>
					<span>The blossom’d thorn-tree and her sleeping lover.<br/></span>
					<span>Nine times she waved the fluttering wimple round,<br/></span>
					<span>And made a little plot of magic ground.<br/></span>
					<span>And in that daised circle, as men say,<br/></span>
					<span>Is Merlin prisoner till the judgment-day;<br/></span>
					<span>But she herself whither she will can rove⁠—<br/></span>
					<span>For she was passing weary of his love.<br/></span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">YOUTH AND CALM</h2>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis death! and peace, indeed, is here,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And ease from shame, and rest from fear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There’s nothing can dismarble now</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The smoothness of that limpid brow.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But is a calm like this, in truth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The crowning end of life and youth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And when this boon rewards the dead,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are all debts paid, has all been said?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And is the heart of youth so light,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its step so firm, its eyes so bright,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Because on its hot brow there blows</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A wind of promise and repose</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From the far grave, to which it goes;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Because it hath the hope to come,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>One day, to harbour in the tomb?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah no, the bliss youth dreams is one</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For daylight, for the cheerful sun,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For feeling nerves and living breath⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Youth dreams a bliss on this side death.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It dreams a rest, if not more deep,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>More grateful than this marble sleep;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It hears a voice within it tell:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Calm’s not life’s crown, though calm is well.</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Tis all perhaps which man acquires,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But ’tis not what our youth desires.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Goethe in Weimar sleeps, and Greece,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Long since, saw Byron’s struggle cease.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But one such death remain’d to come;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The last poetic voice is dumb⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We stand to-day by Wordsworth’s tomb.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Byron’s eyes were shut in death,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We bow’d our head and held our breath.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He taught us little; but our soul</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Had <i>felt</i> him like the thunder’s roll.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With shivering heart the strife we saw</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of passion with eternal law;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And yet with reverential awe</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We watch’d the fount of fiery life</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which served for that Titanic strife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Goethe’s death was told, we said:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sunk, then, is Europe’s sagest head.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Physician of the iron age,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Goethe has done his pilgrimage.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He took the suffering human race,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He read each wound, each weakness clear;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And struck his finger on the place,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And said: <i>Thou ailest here, and here!</i></span>
						<br/>
				<span>He look’d on Europe’s dying hour</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of fitful dream and feverish power;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His eye plunged down the weltering strife,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The turmoil of expiring life⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He said: <i>The end is everywhere,</i></span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Art still has truth, take refuge there!</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And he was happy, if to know</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Causes of things, and far below</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His feet to see the lurid flow</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of terror, and insane distress,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And headlong fate, be happiness.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Wordsworth!⁠—Ah, pale ghosts, rejoice!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For never has such soothing voice</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Been to your shadowy world convey’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Since erst, at morn, some wandering shade</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heard the clear song of Orpheus come</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through Hades, and the mournful gloom.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wordsworth has gone from us⁠—and ye,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah, may ye feel his voice as we!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He too upon a wintry clime</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Had fallen⁠—on this iron time</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of doubts, disputes, distractions, fears.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He found us when the age had bound</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our souls in its benumbing round;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He laid us as we lay at birth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the cool flowery lap of earth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Smiles broke from us and we had ease;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The hills were round us, and the breeze</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Went o’er the sun-lit fields again;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our foreheads felt the wind and rain.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our youth return’d; for there was shed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On spirits that had long been dead,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Spirits dried up and closely furl’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The freshness of the early world.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! since dark days still bring to light</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Man’s prudence and man’s fiery might,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Time may restore us in his course</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Goethe’s sage mind and Byron’s force;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But where will Europe’s latter hour</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Again find Wordsworth’s healing power?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Others will teach us how to dare,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And against fear our breast to steel;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Others will strengthen us to bear⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But who, ah! who, will make us feel?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The cloud of mortal destiny,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Others will front it fearlessly⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But who, like him, will put it by?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Keep fresh the grass upon his grave</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O Rotha, with thy living wave!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sing him thy best! for few or none</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hears thy voice right, now he is gone.</span>

						<br/>
				<span>And watch thee pass unconscious by,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And spell thy looks, and guess thy thoughts,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mixt with the idlers on the pier.⁠—</span>

				<span>Where ignorant armies clash by night.</span>

				<span>I saw him sensitive in frame,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I knew his spirits low;</span>

				<span>And wish’d him health, success, and fame⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I do not wish it now.</span>

				<span>For these are all their own reward,</span>

				<span>They try us, oftenest make us hard,</span>

				<span>Alas! yet to the suffering man,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In this his mortal state,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Friends could not give what fortune can⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Health, ease, a heart elate.</span>

			<p>
				<span>But he is now by fortune foil’d</span>

				<span>Raised are the dripping oars,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Silent the boat! the lake,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lovely and soft as a dream,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Swims in the sheen of the moon.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The mountains stand at its head</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Clear in the pure June-night,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But the valleys are flooded with haze.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rydal and Fairfield are there;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the shadow Wordsworth lies dead.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So it is, so it will be for aye.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nature is fresh as of old,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is lovely; a mortal is dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The spots which recall him survive,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For he lent a new life to these hills.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Pillar still broods o’er the fields</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which border Ennerdale Lake,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Egremont sleeps by the sea.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The gleam of The Evening Star</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Twinkles on Grasmere no more,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But ruin’d and solemn and grey</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The sheepfold of Michael survives;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, far to the south, the heath</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still blows in the Quantock coombs,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By the favourite waters of Ruth.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>These survive!⁠—yet not without pain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pain and dejection to-night,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Can I feel that their poet is gone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He grew old in an age he condemn’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He look’d on the rushing decay</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the times which had shelter’d his youth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Felt the dissolving throes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of a social order he loved;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Outlived his brethren, his peers;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, like the Theban seer,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Died in his enemies’ day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cold bubbled the spring of Tilphusa,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Copais lay bright in the moon,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Helicon glass’d in the lake</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its firs, and afar rose the peaks</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Parnassus, snowily clear;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thebes was behind him in flames,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the clang of arms in his ear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When his awe-struck captors led</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Theban seer to the spring.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tiresias drank and died.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor did reviving Thebes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>See such a prophet again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well may we mourn, when the head</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of a sacred poet lies low</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In an age which can rear them no more!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The complaining millions of men</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Darken in labour and pain;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But he was a priest to us all</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the wonder and bloom of the world,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which we saw with his eyes, and were glad.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He is dead, and the fruit-bearing day</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of his race is past on the earth;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And darkness returns to our eyes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For, oh! is it you, is it you,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Moonlight, and shadow, and lake,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And mountains, that fill us with joy,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or the poet who sings you so well?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is it you, O beauty, O grace,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O charm, O romance, that we feel,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or the voice which reveals what you are?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are ye, like daylight and sun,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shared and rejoiced in by all?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or are ye immersed in the mass</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of matter, and hard to extract,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or sunk at the core of the world</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Too deep for the most to discern?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like stars in the deep of the sky,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which arise on the glass of the sage,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But are lost when their watcher is gone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“They are here”⁠—I heard, as men heard</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In Mysian Ida the voice</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the Mighty Mother, or Crete,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The murmur of Nature reply⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Loveliness, magic, and grace,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They are here! they are set in the world,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They abide; and the finest of souls</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath not been thrill’d by them all,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor the dullest been dead to them quite.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The poet who sings them may die,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But they are immortal and live,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For they are the life of the world.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Will ye not learn it, and know,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When ye mourn that a poet is dead,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That the singer was less than his themes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Life, and emotion, and I?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“More than the singer are these.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Weak is the tremor of pain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That thrills in his mournfullest chord</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To that which once ran through his soul.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cold the elation of joy</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In his gladdest, airiest song,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To that which of old in his youth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fill’d him and made him divine.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hardly his voice at its best</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gives us a sense of the awe,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The vastness, the grandeur, the gloom</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the unlit gulph of himself.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye know not yourselves; and your bards⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The clearest, the best, who have read</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Most in themselves⁠—have beheld</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Less than they left unreveal’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ye express not yourselves;⁠—can you make</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With marble, with colour, with word,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What charm’d you in others re-live?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Can thy pencil, O artist! restore</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The figure, the bloom of thy love,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As she was in her morning of spring?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Canst thou paint the ineffable smile</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of her eyes as they rested on thine?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Can the image of life have the glow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The motion of life itself?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yourselves and your fellows ye know not; and me,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The mateless, the one, will ye know?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Will ye scan me, and read me, and tell</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the thoughts that ferment in my breast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My longing, my sadness, my joy?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Will ye claim for your great ones the gift</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To have render’d the gleam of my skies,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To have echoed the moan of my seas,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Utter’d the voice of my hills?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When your great ones depart, will ye say:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>All things have suffer’d a loss,</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Nature is hid in their grave?</i>
					
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Race after race, man after man,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have thought that my secret was theirs,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have dream’d that I lived but for them,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That they were my glory and joy.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—They are dust, they are changed, they are gone!</span>

				<span>This, I know, is the law.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yes! but more than this,</span>

				<span>Thou who seest us die</span>

						<br/>
				<span>Mild and inscrutably calm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well for us that we change!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Well for us that the power</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which in our morning-prime</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Saw the mistakes of our youth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sweet, and forgiving, and good,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sees the contrition of age!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Behold, O Nature, this pair!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>See them to-night where they stand,</span>	
						<br/>
				<span>Not with the halo of youth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crowning their brows with its light,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not with the sunshine of hope,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not with the rapture of spring,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which they had of old, when they stood</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Years ago at my side</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In this self-same garden, and said:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“We are young, and the world is ours;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Man, man is the king of the world!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fools that these mystics are</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who prate of Nature! for she</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath neither beauty, nor warmth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor life, nor emotion, nor power.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But man has a thousand gifts,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the generous dreamer invests</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The senseless world with them all.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nature is nothing; her charm</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lives in our eyes which can paint,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lives in our hearts which can feel.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou, O Nature, wast mute,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mute as of old! days flew,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Days and years; and Time</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With the ceaseless stroke of his wings</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Brush’d off the bloom from their soul.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Clouded and dim grew their eye,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Languid their heart⁠—for youth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Quicken’d its pulses no more.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Slowly, within the walls</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of an ever-narrowing world,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They droop’d, they grew blind, they grew old.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thee and their youth in thee,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nature! they saw no more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Murmur of living,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stir of existence,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Soul of the world!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Make, oh, make yourselves felt</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To the dying spirit of youth!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come, like the breath of the spring!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Leave not a human soul</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To grow old in darkness and pain!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Only the living can feel you,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Here they stand to-night⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here, where this grey balustrade</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crowns the still valley; behind</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is the castled house, with its woods,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which shelter’d their childhood⁠—the sun</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On its ivied windows; a scent</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From the grey-wall’d gardens, a breath</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the fragrant stock and the pink,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Perfumes the evening air.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their children play on the lawns.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They stand and listen; they hear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The children’s shouts, and at times,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Faintly, the bark of a dog</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From a distant farm in the hills.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nothing besides! in front</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The wide, wide valley outspreads</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To the dim horizon, reposed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the twilight, and bathed in dew,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Corn-field and hamlet and copse</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Darkening fast; but a light,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Far off, a glory of day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still plays on the city spires;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And there in the dusk by the walls,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With the grey mist marking its course</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through the silent, flowery land,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On, to the plains, to the sea,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Floats the imperial stream.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well I know what they feel!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They gaze, and the evening wind</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Plays on their faces; they gaze⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Airs from the Eden of youth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Awake and stir in their soul;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The past returns⁠—they feel</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What they are, alas! what they were.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They, not Nature, are changed.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Well I know what they feel!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hush, for tears</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Begin to steal to their eyes!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hush, for fruit</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Grows from such sorrow as theirs!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And they remember,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With piercing, untold anguish,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The proud boasting of their youth.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And they feel how Nature was fair.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the mists of delusion,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the scales of habit,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fall away from their eyes;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And they see, for a moment,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stretching out, like the desert</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In its weary, unprofitable length,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their faded, ignoble lives.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While the locks are yet brown on thy head,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>While the soul still looks through thine eyes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>While the heart still pours</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The mantling blood to thy cheek,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sink, O youth, in thy soul!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yearn to the greatness of Nature;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rally the good in the depths of thyself!</span>

				<span>In this lone, open glade I lie,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Screen’d by deep boughs on either hand;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And at its end, to stay the eye,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Those black-crown’d, red-boled pine-trees stand!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Birds here make song, each bird has his,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Across the girdling city’s hum.</span>

				<span>How green under the boughs it is!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How thick the tremulous sheep-cries come!</span>

			<p>
				<span>Sometimes a child will cross the glade</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To take his nurse his broken toy;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sometimes a thrush flit overhead</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Deep in her unknown day’s employ.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here at my feet what wonders pass,</span>

				<span>What blowing daisies, fragrant grass!</span>

				<span>An air-stirr’d forest, fresh and clear.</span>

						<br/>
				<span>Counts his day’s spoil, the spotted trout.</span>
			</p>

				<span>In the huge world, which roars hard by,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Be others happy if they can!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But in my helpless cradle I</span>

						<br/>
				<span>Think often, as I hear them rave,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That peace has left the upper world</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And now keeps only in the grave.</span>

				<span>The flowers upclose, the birds are fed,</span>

				<span>And she, whose censure thou dost dread,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose eye thou wast afraid to seek,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>See, on her face a glow is spread,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A strong emotion on her cheek!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Ah, child!” she cries, “that strife divine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whence was it, for it is not mine?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There is no effort on <i>my</i> brow⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I do not strive, I do not weep;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I rush with the swift spheres and glow</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In joy, and when I will, I sleep.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet that severe, that earnest air,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I saw, I felt it once⁠—but where?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I knew not yet the gauge of time,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor wore the manacles of space;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I felt it in some other clime,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I saw it in some other place.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Twas when the heavenly house I trod,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And lay upon the breast of God.”</span>

				<span>The Master stood upon the mount, and taught.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He saw a fire in his disciples’ eyes;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“The old law,” they cried, “is wholly come to nought,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Behold the new world rise!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Was it,” the Lord then said, “with scorn ye saw</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The old law observed by Scribes and Pharisees?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I say unto you, see <i>ye</i> keep that law</span>
						<br/>
				<span>More faithfully than these!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Too hasty heads for ordering worlds, alas!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Think not that I to annul the law have will’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No jot, no tittle from the law shall pass,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Till all have been fulfill’d.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Christ said eighteen hundred years ago.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And what then shall be said to those to-day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who cry aloud to lay the old world low</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To clear the new world’s way?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Religious fervours! ardour misapplied!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hence, hence,” they cry, “ye do but keep man blind!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But keep him self-immersed, preoccupied,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And lame the active mind!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! from the old world let some one answer give:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Scorn ye this world, their tears, their inward cares?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I say unto you, see that <i>your</i> souls live</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A deeper life than theirs!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Say ye: ‘The spirit of man has found new roads,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And we must leave the old faiths, and walk therein’?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Leave then the Cross as ye have left carved gods,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But guard the fire within!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Bright else and fast the stream of life may roll,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And no man may the other’s hurt behold;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet each will have one anguish⁠—his own soul</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which perishes of cold.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here let that voice make end; then, let a strain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From a far lonelier distance, like the wind</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Be heard, floating through heaven, and fill again</span>
						<br/>
				<span>These men’s profoundest mind:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Children of men! the unseen Power, whose eye</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For ever doth accompany mankind,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath look’d on no religion scornfully</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That men did ever find.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Which has not taught weak wills how much they can?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which has not fall’n on the dry heart like rain?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which has not cried to sunk, self-weary man:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Thou must be born again!</i>
					
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Children of men! not that your age excel</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In pride of life the ages of your sires,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But that ye think clear, feel deep, bear fruit well,</span>
						<br/>

				<span>A wanderer is man from his birth.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He was born in a ship</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the breast of the river of Time;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Brimming with wonder and joy</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spreads out his arms to the light,</span>

				<span>Rivets his gaze on the banks of the stream.</span>

			<p>

				<span>Whether he wakes,</span>

				<span>Where the snowy mountainous pass,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Echoing the screams of the eagles,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hems in its gorges the bed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the new-born clear-flowing stream;</span>

				<span>Whether in sound of the swallowing sea⁠—</span>

			</p>
			<p>

						<br/>
				<span>Fable and dream</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the lands which the river of Time</span>

				<span>Or shall reach when his eyes have been closed.</span>

						<br/>
				<span>With a thousand cries is its stream.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And we on its breast, our minds</span>

				<span>In a blacker, incessanter line;</span>

				<span>Freshening its current and spotted with foam</span>

				<span>As the pale waste widens around him,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As the banks fade dimmer away,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As the stars come out, and the night-wind</span>

				<span>Brings up the stream</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">A SUMMER NIGHT</h2>
			<p>
				<span>In the deserted, moon-blanch’d street,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How lonely rings the echo of my feet!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Those windows, which I gaze at, frown,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Silent and white, unopening down,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Repellent as the world;⁠—but see,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A break between the housetops shows</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The moon! and, lost behind her, fading dim</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Into the dewy dark obscurity</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down at the far horizon’s rim,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Doth a whole tract of heaven disclose!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And to my mind the thought</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is on a sudden brought</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of a past night, and a far different scene.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Headlands stood out into the moonlit deep</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As clearly as at noon;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The spring-tide’s brimming flow</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heaved dazzlingly between;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Houses, with long white sweep,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Girdled the glistening bay;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Behind, through the soft air,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The blue haze-cradled mountains spread away,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The night was far more fair⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But the same restless pacings to and fro,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the same vainly throbbing heart was there,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the same bright, calm moon.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the calm moonlight seems to say:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Hast thou then still the old unquiet breast,</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Which neither deadens into rest,</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Nor ever feels the fiery glow</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>That whirls the spirit from itself away,</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>But fluctuates to and fro,</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Never by passion quite possess’d</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span><i>And never quite benumb’d by the world’s sway?</i>⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I, I know not if to pray</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still to be what I am, or yield and be</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like all the other men I see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For most men in a brazen prison live,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where, in the sun’s hot eye,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With heads bent o’er their toil, they languidly</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their lives to some unmeaning taskwork give,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dreaming of nought beyond their prison-wall.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And as, year after year,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fresh products of their barren labour fall</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From their tired hands, and rest</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Never yet comes more near,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gloom settles slowly down over their breast;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And while they try to stem</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The waves of mournful thought by which they are prest,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Death in their prison reaches them,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Unfreed, having seen nothing, still unblest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the rest, a few,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Escape their prison and depart</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the wide ocean of life anew.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There the freed prisoner, where’er his heart</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Listeth, will sail;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor doth he know how there prevail,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Despotic on that sea,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Trade-winds which cross it from eternity.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Awhile he holds some false way, undebarr’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By thwarting signs, and braves</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The freshening wind and blackening waves.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then the tempest strikes him; and between</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The lightning-bursts is seen</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Only a driving wreck,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the pale master on his spar-strewn deck</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With anguish’d face and flying hair</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Grasping the rudder hard,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still bent to make some port he knows not where,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still standing for some false, impossible shore.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And sterner comes the roar</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of sea and wind, and through the deepening gloom</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fainter and fainter wreck and helmsman loom,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And he too disappears, and comes no more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Is there no life, but these alone?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Madman or slave, must man be one?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Plainness and clearness without shadow of stain!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Clearness divine!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ye heavens, whose pure dark regions have no sign</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of languor, though so calm, and, though so great,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are yet untroubled and unpassionate;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who, though so noble, share in the world’s toil,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, though so task’d, keep free from dust and soil!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I will not say that your mild deeps retain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A tinge, it may be, of their silent pain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who have long’d deeply once, and long’d in vain⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But I will rather say that you remain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A world above man’s head, to let him see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How boundless might his soul’s horizons be,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How vast, yet of what clear transparency!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How it were good to abide there, and breathe free;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How fair a lot to fill</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is left to each man still!</span>

				<span>Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I feel a nameless sadness o’er me roll.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yes, yes, we know that we can jest,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We know, we know that we can smile!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But there’s a something in this breast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To which thy light words bring no rest,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thy gay smiles no anodyne.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And turn those limpid eyes on mine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And let me read there, love! thy inmost soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alas! is even love too weak</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To unlock the heart, and let it speak?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are even lovers powerless to reveal</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To one another what indeed they feel?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I knew the mass of men conceal’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They would by other men be met</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I knew they lived and moved</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Trick’d in disguises, alien to the rest</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of men, and alien to themselves⁠—and yet</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The same heart beats in every human breast!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But we, my love!⁠—doth a like spell benumb</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our hearts, our voices?⁠—must we too be dumb?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! well for us, if even we,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Even for a moment, can get free</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our heart, and have our lips unchain’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For that which seals them hath been deep-ordain’d!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fate, which foresaw</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How frivolous a baby man would be⁠—⁠</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By what distractions he would be possess’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How he would pour himself in every strife,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And well-nigh change his own identity⁠—⁠</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That it might keep from his capricious play</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His genuine self, and force him to obey</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Even in his own despite his being’s law,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bade through the deep recesses of our breast</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The unregarded river of our life</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And that we should not see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The buried stream, and seem to be</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Eddying at large in blind uncertainty,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though driving on with it eternally.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But often, in the world’s most crowded streets,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But often, in the din of strife,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There rises an unspeakable desire</span>
						<br/>
				<span>After the knowledge of our buried life;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A thirst to spend our fire and restless force</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In tracking out our true, original course;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A longing to inquire</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Into the mystery of this heart which beats</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So wild, so deep in us⁠—to know</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whence our lives come and where they go.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And many a man in his own breast then delves,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But deep enough, alas! none ever mines.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And we have been on many thousand lines,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And we have shown, on each, spirit and power;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But hardly have we, for one little hour,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Been on our own line, have we been ourselves⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hardly had skill to utter one of all</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The nameless feelings that course through our breast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But they course on for ever unexpress’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And long we try in vain to speak and act</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our hidden self, and what we say and do</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is eloquent, is well⁠—but ’tis not true!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then we will no more be rack’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With inward striving, and demand</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of all the thousand nothings of the hour</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their stupefying power;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah yes, and they benumb us at our call!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From the soul’s subterranean depth upborne</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As from an infinitely distant land,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A melancholy into all our day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Only⁠—but this is rare⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When a belovéd hand is laid in ours,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When, jaded with the rush and glare</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the interminable hours,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our eyes can in another’s eyes read clear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When our world-deafen’d ear</span>
						<br/>

						<br/>
				<span>A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A man becomes aware of his life’s flow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And hears its winding murmur; and he sees</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And there arrives a lull in the hot race</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wherein he doth for ever chase</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That flying and elusive shadow, rest.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>An air of coolness plays upon his face,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then he thinks he knows</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The hills where his life rose,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the sea where it goes.</span>

						<br/>
				<span>The world, which for an idle day</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Grace to your mood of sadness gave,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Long since hath flung her weeds away.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The eternal trifler breaks your spell;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But we⁠—we learnt your lore too well!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Years hence, perhaps, may dawn an age,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>More fortunate, alas! than we,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which without hardness will be sage,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And gay without frivolity.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sons of the world, oh, speed those years;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, while we wait, allow our tears!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Allow them! We admire with awe</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The exulting thunder of your race;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>You give the universe your law,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>You triumph over time and space!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Your pride of life, your tireless powers,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We laud them, but they are not ours.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We are like children rear’d in shade</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beneath some old-world abbey wall,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Forgotten in a forest-glade,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And secret from the eyes of all.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Deep, deep the greenwood round them waves,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their abbey, and its close of graves!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But, where the road runs near the stream,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Oft through the trees they catch a glance</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of passing troops in the sun’s beam⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pennon, and plume, and flashing lance!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Forth to the world those soldiers fare,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To life, to cities, and to war!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And through the wood, another way,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Faint bugle-notes from far are borne,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where hunters gather, staghounds bay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Round some fair forest-lodge at morn.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gay dames are there, in sylvan green;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Laughter and cries⁠—those notes between!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The banners flashing through the trees</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Make their blood dance and chain their eyes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That bugle-music on the breeze</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Arrests them with a charm’d surprise.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Banner by turns and bugle woo:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Ye shy recluses, follow too!</i>
					
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O children, what do ye reply?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Action and pleasure, will ye roam</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through these secluded dells to cry</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And call us?⁠—but too late ye come!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Too late for us your call ye blow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose bent was taken long ago.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Long since we pace this shadow’d nave;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We watch those yellow tapers shine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Emblems of hope over the grave,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the high altar’s depth divine;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The organ carries to our ear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its accents of another sphere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Fenced early in this cloistral round</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of reverie, of shade, of prayer,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How should we grow in other ground?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How can we flower in foreign air?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Pass, banners, pass, and bugles, cease;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And leave our desert to its peace!”</span>

					<span>Down the Savoy valleys sounding,</span>

					<span>Echoing round this castle old,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>‘Mid the distant mountain-chalets</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hark! what bell for church is toll’d?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In the bright October morning</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Savoy’s Duke had left his bride.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>From the castle, past the drawbridge,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Flow’d the hunters’ merry tide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Steeds are neighing, gallants glittering;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Gay, her smiling lord to greet,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>From her mullion’d chamber-casement</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Smiles the Duchess Marguerite.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From Vienna, by the Danube,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Here she came, a bride, in spring.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Now the autumn crisps the forest;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hunters gather, bugles ring.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hounds are pulling, prickers swearing,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Horses fret, and boar-spears glance.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Off!⁠—They sweep the marshy forests,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Westward, on the side of France.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hark! the game’s on foot; they scatter!⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Down the forest-ridings lone,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Furious, single horsemen gallop⁠—⁠</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hark! a shout⁠—a crash⁠—a groan!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Pale and breathless, came the hunters;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On the turf dead lies the boar⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>God! the Duke lies stretch’d beside him,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Senseless, weltering in his gore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In the dull October evening,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Down the leaf-strewn forest-road,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To the castle, past the drawbridge,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Came the hunters with their load.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In the hall, with sconces blazing,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Ladies waiting round her seat,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Clothed in smiles, beneath the daïs</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Sate the Duchess Marguerite.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hark! below the gates unbarring!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Tramp of men and quick commands!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“⁠—’Tis my lord come back from hunting⁠—”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the Duchess claps her hands.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Slow and tired, came the hunters⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Stopp’d in darkness in the court.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“⁠—Ho, this way, ye laggard hunters!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To the hall! What sport? What sport?”⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Slow they enter’d with their master;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In the hall they laid him down.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On his coat were leaves and blood-stains,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On his brow an angry frown.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dead her princely youthful husband</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Lay before his youthful wife,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Bloody, ’neath the flaring sconces⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the sight froze all her life.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In Vienna, by the Danube,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Kings hold revel, gallants meet.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Gay of old amid the gayest</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Was the Duchess Marguerite.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In Vienna, by the Danube,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Feast and dance her youth beguiled.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Till that hour she never sorrow’d;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But from then she never smiled.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>‘Mid the Savoy mountain valleys</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Far from town or haunt of man,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Stands a lonely church, unfinish’d,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which the Duchess Maud began;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Old, that Duchess stern began it,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In gray age, with palsied hands;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But she died while it was building,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the Church unfinish’d stands⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Stands as erst the builders left it,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>When she sank into her grave;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Mountain greensward paves the chancel,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Harebells flower in the nave</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“⁠—In my castle all is sorrow,”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Said the Duchess Marguerite then;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Guide me, some one, to the mountain!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>We will build the Church again.”⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sandall’d palmers, faring homeward,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Austrian knights from Syria came.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“⁠—Austrian wanderers bring, O warders!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Homage to your Austrian dame.”⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From the gate the warders answer’d:</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“⁠—Gone, O knights, is she you knew!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Dead our Duke, and gone his Duchess;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Seek her at the Church of Brou!”⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Austrian knights and much-worn palmers</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Climb the winding mountain-way⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Reach the valley, where the Fabric</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Rises higher day by day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Stones are sawing, hammers ringing;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On the work the bright sun shines,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In the Savoy mountain-meadows,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>By the stream, below the pines.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>On her palfrey white the Duchess</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Sate and watch’d her working train⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Flemish carvers, Lombard gilders,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>German masons, smiths from Spain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Clad in black, on her white palfrey,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Her old architect beside⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>There they found her in the mountains,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Morn and noon and eventide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There she sate, and watch’d the builders,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Till the Church was roof’d and done.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Last of all, the builders rear’d her</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In the nave a tomb of stone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>On the tomb two forms they sculptured,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Lifelike in the marble pale⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>One, the Duke in helm and armour;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>One, the Duchess in her veil.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Round the tomb the carved stone fretwork</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Was at Easter-tide put on.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then the Duchess closed her labours;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And she died at the St. John.</span>

					<span>The stream goes leaping by.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The hills are clothed with pines sun-proof;</span>

					<span>’Tis the Church of Brou.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At sunrise, from their dewy lair</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Crossing the stream, the kine are seen</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Round the wall to stray⁠—</span>

					<span>Where last year they lay.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But all things now are order’d fair</span>

							<br/>
					<span>Climb up here to pray;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Burghers and dames, at summer’s prime,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Ride out to church from Chambery,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Dight with mantles gay.</span>

					<span>But else it is a lonely time</span>

					<span>Round the Church of Brou.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>On Sundays, too, a priest doth come</span>
							<br/>
					<span>From the wall’d town beyond the pass,</span>

					<span>Down the mountain-way;</span>

					<span>You hear the white-robed priest say mass,</span>

					<span>Where thou, young Prince! shall never more arise</span>

					<span>From the fringed mattress where thy Duchess lies,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On autumn-mornings, when the bugle sounds,</span>

				<span>And the first grey of morning fill’d the east,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the fog rose out of the Oxus stream.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But all the Tartar camp along the stream</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Was hush’d, and still the men were plunged in sleep;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sohrab alone, he slept not; all night long</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He had lain wakeful, tossing on his bed;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But when the grey dawn stole into his tent,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And took his horseman’s cloak, and left his tent,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And went abroad into the cold wet fog,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa’s tent.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through the black Tartar tents he pass’d, which stood</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Clustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Oxus, where the summer-floods o’erflow</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When the sun melts the snows in high Pamere;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through the black tents he pass’d, o’er that low strand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And to a hillock came, a little back</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From the stream’s brink⁠—the spot where first a boat,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crossing the stream in summer, scrapes the land.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The men of former times had crown’d the top</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With a clay fort; but that was fall’n, and now</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa’s tent,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A dome of laths, and o’er it felts were spread.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Sohrab came there, and went in, and stood</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And found the old man sleeping on his bed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of rugs and felts, and near him lay his arms.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Peran-Wisa heard him, though the step</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Was dull’d; for he slept light, an old man’s sleep;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And he rose quickly on one arm, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Who art thou? for it is not yet clear dawn.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Speak! is there news, or any night alarm?”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Sohrab came to the bedside, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Thou know’st me, Peran-Wisa! it is I.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The sun is not yet risen, and the foe</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sleep; but I sleep not; all night long I lie</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tossing and wakeful, and I come to thee.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For so did King Afrasiab bid me seek</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thy counsel, and to heed thee as thy son,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In Samarcand, before the army march’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I will tell thee what my heart desires.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou know’st if, since from Ader-baijan first</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I came among the Tartars and bore arms,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I have still served Afrasiab well, and shown,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>At my boy’s years, the courage of a man.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This too thou know’st, that while I still bear on</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And beat the Persians back on every field,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I seek one man, one man, and one alone⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rustum, my father; who I hoped should greet,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Should one day greet, upon some well-fought field,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His not unworthy, not inglorious son.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So I long hoped, but him I never find.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come then, hear now, and grant me what I ask.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let the two armies rest to-day; but I</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To meet me, man to man; if I prevail,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rustum will surely hear it; if I fall⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Old man, the dead need no one, claim no kin.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dim is the rumour of a common fight,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where host meets host, and many names are sunk;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But of a single combat fame speaks clear.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the hand</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the young man in his, and sigh’d, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“O Sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Canst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And share the battle’s common chance with us</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who love thee, but must press for ever first,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In single fight incurring single risk,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To find a father thou hast never seen?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That were far best, my son, to stay with us</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Unmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And when ’tis truce, then in Afrasiab’s towns.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, if this one desire indeed rules all,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To seek out Rustum⁠—seek him not through fight!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Seek him in peace, and carry to his arms,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O Sohrab, carry an unwounded son!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But far hence seek him, for he is not here.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For now it is not as when I was young,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When Rustum was in front of every fray;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But now he keeps apart, and sits at home,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In Seistan, with Zal, his father old.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whether that his own mighty strength at last</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Feels the abhorr’d approaches of old age,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or in some quarrel with the Persian King.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There go!⁠—Thou wilt not? Yet my heart forebodes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Danger or death awaits thee on this field.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fain would I know thee safe and well, though lost</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To us; fain therefore send thee hence, in peace</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To seek thy father, not seek single fights</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In vain;⁠—but who can keep the lion’s cub</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From ravening, and who govern Rustum’s son?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Go, I will grant thee what thy heart desires.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So said he, and dropp’d Sohrab’s hand, and left</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And o’er his chilly limbs his woollen coat</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He pass’d, and tied his sandals on his feet,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And threw a white cloak round him, and he took</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In his right hand a ruler’s staff, no sword;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And on his head he set his sheep-skin cap,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Black, glossy, curl’d, the fleece of Kara-Kul;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And raised the curtain of his tent, and call’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His herald to his side, and went abroad.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The sun by this had risen, and clear’d the fog</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Into the open plain; so Haman bade⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Haman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The host, and still was in his lusty prime.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From their black tents, long files of horse, they stream’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As when some grey November morn the files,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In marching order spread, of long-neck’d cranes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or some frore Caspian reed-bed, southward bound</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For the warm Persian sea-board⁠—so they stream’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Tartars of the Oxus, the King’s guard,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Large men, large steeds; who from Bokhara come</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Tukas, and the lances of Salore,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Light men and on light steeds, who only drink</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The acrid milk of camels, and their wells.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then a swarm of wandering horse, who came</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From far, and a more doubtful service own’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Tartars of Ferghana, from the banks</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the Jaxartes, men with scanty beards</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who roam o’er Kipchak and the northern waste,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who stray</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>These all filed out from camp into the plain.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And on the other side the Persians form’d;⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>First a light cloud of horse, Tartars they seem’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Ilyats of Khorassan; and behind,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The royal troops of Persia, horse and foot,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Marshall’d battalions bright in burnish’d steel.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Peran-Wisa with his herald came,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And when Ferood, who led the Persians, saw</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He took his spear, and to the front he came,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And check’d his ranks, and fix’d them where they stood.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the old Tartar came upon the sand</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let there be truce between the hosts to-day.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But choose a champion from the Persian lords</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To fight our champion Sohrab, man to man.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As, in the country, on a morn in June,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When the dew glistens on the pearled ears,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A shiver runs through the deep corn for joy⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But as a troop of pedlars, from Cabool,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Slake their parch’d throats with sugar’d mulberries⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In single file they move, and stop their breath,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For fear they should dislodge the o’erhanging snows⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So the pale Persians held their breath with fear.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah came,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Second, and was the uncle of the King;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>These came and counsell’d, and then Gudurz said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet champion have we none to match this youth.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He has the wild stag’s foot, the lion’s heart.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Rustum came last night; aloof he sits</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And sullen, and has pitch’d his tents apart.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Him will I seek, and carry to his ear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Tartar challenge, and this young man’s name.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Haply he will forget his wrath, and fight.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stand forth the while, and take their challenge up.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let Sohrab arm, and we will find a man.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spake: and Peran-Wisa turn’d, and strode</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Back through the opening squadrons to his tent.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And cross’d the camp which lay behind, and reach’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Out on the sands beyond it, Rustum’s tents.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Just pitch’d; the high pavilion in the midst</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Was Rustum’s, and his men lay camp’d around.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Gudurz enter’d Rustum’s tent, and found</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rustum; his morning meal was done, but still</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The table stood before him, charged with food⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And dark green melons; and there Rustum sate</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Listless, and held a falcon on his wrist,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And play’d with it; but Gudurz came and stood</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Before him; and he look’d, and saw him stand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And with a cry sprang up and dropp’d the bird,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And greeted Gudurz with both hands, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Welcome! these eyes could see no better sight.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What news? but sit down first, and eat and drink.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Not now! a time will come to eat and drink,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But not to-day; to-day has other needs.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For from the Tartars is a challenge brought</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To pick a champion from the Persian lords</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To fight their champion⁠—and thou know’st his name⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sohrab men call him, but his birth is hid.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O Rustum, like thy might is this young man’s!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He has the wild stag’s foot, the lion’s heart;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And he is young, and Iran’s chiefs are old,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke; but Rustum answer’d with a smile:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Go to! if Iran’s chiefs are old, then I</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Am older; if the young are weak, the King</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Errs strangely; for the King, for Kai Khosroo,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Himself is young, and honours younger men,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And lets the aged moulder to their graves.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rustum he loves no more, but loves the young⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The young may rise at Sohrab’s vaunts, not I.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For what care I, though all speak Sohrab’s fame?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For would that I myself had such a son,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And not that one slight helpless girl I have⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A son so famed, so brave, to send to war,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I to tarry with the snow-hair’d Zal,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My father, whom the robber Afghans vex,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And clip his borders short, and drive his herds,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And he has none to guard his weak old age.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There would I go, and hang my armour up,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And with my great name fence that weak old man,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And spend the goodly treasures I have got,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And rest my age, and hear of Sohrab’s fame,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“What then, O Rustum, will men say to this,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hidest thy face? Take heed lest men should say:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Like some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame,</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span><i>And shuns to peril it with younger men.</i>”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou knowest better words than this to say.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What is one more, one less, obscure or famed,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Valiant or craven, young or old, to me?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are not they mortal, am not I myself?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But who for men of nought would do great deeds?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But I will fight unknown, and in plain arms;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let not men say of Rustum, he was match’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In single fight with any mortal man.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke, and frown’d; and Gudurz turn’d, and ran</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Rustum strode to his tent-door, and call’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His followers in, and bade them bring his arms,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And clad himself in steel; the arms he chose</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Were plain, and on his shield was no device,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Only his helm was rich, inlaid with gold,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, from the fluted spine atop, a plume</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So arm’d, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Follow’d him like a faithful hound at heel⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The horse, whom Rustum on a foray once</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Did in Bokhara by the river find</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A colt beneath its dam, and drove him home,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And rear’d him; a bright bay, with lofty crest,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dight with a saddle-cloth of broider’d green</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crusted with gold, and on the ground were work’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So follow’d, Rustum left his tents, and cross’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The camp, and to the Persian host appear’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And all the Persians knew him, and with shouts</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hail’d; but the Tartars knew not who he was.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And dear as the wet diver to the eyes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By sandy Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Plunging all day in the blue waves, at night,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Having made up his tale of precious pearls,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Rustum to the Persian front advanced,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Sohrab arm’d in Haman’s tent, and came.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And as afield the reapers cut a swath</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down through the middle of a rich man’s corn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And on each side are squares of standing corn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And in the midst a stubble, short and bare⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So on each side were squares of men, with spears</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bristling, and in the midst, the open sand.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Rustum came upon the sand, and cast</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As some rich woman, on a winter’s morn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who with numb blacken’d fingers makes her fire⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>At cock-crow, on a starlit winter’s morn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When the frost flowers the whiten’d window-panes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The unknown adventurous youth, who from afar</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Came seeking Rustum, and defying forth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All the most valiant chiefs; long he perused</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His spirited air, and wonder’d who he was.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For very young he seem’d, tenderly rear’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which in a queen’s secluded garden throws</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By midnight, to a bubbling fountain’s sound⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So slender Sohrab seem’d, so softly rear’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And a deep pity enter’d Rustum’s soul</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As he beheld him coming; and he stood,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And beckon’d to him with his hand, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“O thou young man, the air of Heaven is soft,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heaven’s air is better than the cold dead grave.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Behold me! I am vast, and clad in iron,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And tried; and I have stood on many a field</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of blood, and I have fought with many a foe⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Never was that field lost, or that foe saved.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Be govern’d! quit the Tartar host, and come</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To Iran, and be as my son to me,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And fight beneath my banner till I die!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There are no youths in Iran brave as thou.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So he spake, mildly; Sohrab heard his voice,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His giant figure planted on the sand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sole, like some single tower, which a chief</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath builded on the waste in former years</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Against the robbers; and he saw that head,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Streak’d with its first grey hairs;⁠—hope filled his soul,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And he ran forward and embraced his knees,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And clasp’d his hand within his own, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“O, by thy father’s head! by thine own soul!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Art thou not Rustum? speak! art thou not he?”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And turn’d away, and spake to his own soul:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Ah me, I muse what this young fox may mean!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>False, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For if I now confess this thing he asks,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And hide it not, but say: <i>Rustum is here!</i></span>
						<br/>
				<span>He will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But he will find some pretext not to fight,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A belt or sword perhaps, and go his way.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab’s hall,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In Samarcand, he will arise and cry:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>‘I challenged once, when the two armies camp’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beside the Oxus, all the Persian lords</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To cope with me in single fight; but they</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.’</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then he turn’d, and sternly spake aloud:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast call’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rash boy, men look on Rustum’s face and flee!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For well I know, that did great Rustum stand</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Before thy face this day, and were reveal’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There would be then no talk of fighting more.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But being what I am, I tell thee this⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Do thou record it in thine inmost soul:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Oxus in summer wash them all away.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke; and Sohrab answer’d, on his feet:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fright me so!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I am no girl, to be made pale by words.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here on this field, there were no fighting then.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Rustum is far hence, and we stand here.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Begin! thou art more vast, more dread than I,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thou art proved, I know, and I am young⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But yet success sways with the breath of Heaven.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For we are all, like swimmers in the sea,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And whether it will heave us up to land,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or whether it will roll us out to sea,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Back out to sea, to the deep waves of death,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We know not, and no search will make us know;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Only the event will teach us in its hour.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke, and Rustum answer’d not, but hurl’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His spear; down from the shoulder, down it came,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As on some partridge in the corn a hawk,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That long has tower’d in the airy clouds,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Drops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hiss’d, and went quivering down into the sand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which it sent flying wide;⁠—then Sohrab threw</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In turn, and full struck Rustum’s shield; sharp rang,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The iron plates rang sharp, but turn’d the spear.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Rustum seized his club, which none but he</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Could wield; an unlopp’d trunk it was, and huge,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still rough⁠—like those which men in treeless plains</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high up</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By their dark springs, the wind in winter-time</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath made in Himalayan forests wrack,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And strewn the channels with torn boughs⁠—so huge</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The club which Rustum lifted now, and struck</span>
						<br/>
				<span>One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lithe as the glancing snake, and the club came</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum’s hand.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Rustum follow’d his own blow, and fell</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To his knees, and with his fingers clutch’d the sand;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But he look’d on, and smiled, nor bared his sword,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Thou strik’st too hard! that club of thine will float</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Upon the summer-floods, and not my bones.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou say’st, thou art not Rustum; be it so!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who art thou then, that canst so touch my soul?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Boy as I am, I have seen battles too⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have waded foremost in their bloody waves,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And heard their hollow roar of dying men;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But never was my heart thus touch’d before.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come, plant we here in earth our angry spears,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And make a truce, and sit upon this sand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And pledge each other in red wine, like friends,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum’s deeds.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There are enough foes in the Persian host,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Champions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mayst fight; fight <i>them</i>, when they confront thy spear!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But oh, let there be peace ’twixt thee and me!”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He ceased, but while he spake, Rustum had risen,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And stood erect, trembling with rage; his club</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He left to lie, but had regain’d his spear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose fiery point now in his mail’d right-hand</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Blazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His stately crest, and dimm’d his glittering arms.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His breast heaved, his lips foam’d, and twice his voice</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Was choked with rage; at last these words broke way:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Curl’d minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou art not in Afrasiab’s gardens now</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of battle, and with me, who make no play</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of war; I fight it out, and hand to hand.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Remember all thy valour; try thy feints</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And cunning! all the pity I had is gone;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl’s wiles.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his taunts,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And he too drew his sword; at once they rush’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Together, as two eagles on one prey</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come rushing down together from the clouds,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>One from the east, one from the west; their shields</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dash’d with a clang together, and a din</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Make often in the forest’s heart at morn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of hewing axes, crashing trees⁠—such blows</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rustum and Sohrab on each other hail’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And you would say that sun and stars took part</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In that unnatural conflict; for a cloud</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Grew suddenly in Heaven, and dark’d the sun</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Over the fighters’ heads; and a wind rose</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And in a sandy whirlwind wrapp’d the pair.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In gloom they twain were wrapp’d, and they alone;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For both the on-looking hosts on either hand</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rent the tough plates, but fail’d to reach the skin,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Rustum pluck’d it back with angry groan.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum’s helm,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Never till now defiled, sank to the dust;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Rustum bow’d his head; but then the gloom</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who stood at hand, utter’d a dreadful cry;⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No horse’s cry was that, most like the roar</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of some pain’d desert-lion, who all day</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath trail’d the hunter’s javelin in his side,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And comes at night to die upon the sand.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Oxus curdled as it cross’d his stream.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Sohrab heard, and quail’d not, but rush’d on,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And struck again; and again Rustum bow’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His head; but this time all the blade, like glass,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And in the hand the hilt remain’d alone.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And shouted: <i>Rustum!</i>⁠—Sohrab heard that shout,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And shrank amazed; back he recoil’d one step,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And scann’d with blinking eyes the advancing form;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then he stood bewilder’d; and he dropp’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He reel’d, and staggering back, sank to the ground;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then, with a bitter smile, Rustum began:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab’s tent.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or else that the great Rustum would come down</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His heart to take a gift, and let thee go.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then that all the Tartar host would praise</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To glad thy father in his weak old age.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Than to thy friends, and to thy father old.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For were I match’d with ten such men as thee,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I were that which till to-day I was,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They should be lying here, I standing there.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But that belovéd name unnerved my arm⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That name, and something, I confess, in thee,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fall; and thy spear transfix’d an unarm’d foe.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And now thou boastest, and insult’st my fate.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My father, whom I seek through all the world,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As when some hunter in the spring hath found</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A breeding eagle sitting on her nest,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And pierced her with an arrow as she rose,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And follow’d her to find her where she fell</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Far off;⁠—anon her mate comes winging back</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From hunting, and a great way off descries</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His huddling young left sole; at that, he checks</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Circles above his eyry, with loud screams</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In some far stony gorge out of his ken,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A heap of fluttering feathers⁠—never more</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shall the lake glass her, flying over it;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Never the black and dripping precipices</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Echo her stormy scream as she sails by⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Over his dying son, and knew him not.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, with a cold incredulous voice, he said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“What prate is this of fathers and revenge?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The mighty Rustum never had a son.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Surely the news will one day reach his ear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What will that grief, what will that vengeance be?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Oh, could I live, till I that grief had seen!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet him I pity not so much, but her,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With that old king, her father, who grows grey</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With age, and rules over the valiant Koords.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Her most I pity, who no more will see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With spoils and honour, when the war is done.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But a dark rumour will be bruited up,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then will that defenceless woman learn</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But that in battle with a nameless foe,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thinking of her he left, and his own death.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke; but Rustum listen’d, plunged in thought.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor did he yet believe it was his son</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who spoke, although he call’d back names he knew;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For he had had sure tidings that the babe,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which was in Ader-baijan born to him,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Had been a puny girl, no boy at all⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So that sad mother sent him word, for fear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And so he deem’d that either Sohrab took,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By a false boast, the style of Rustum’s son;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So deem’d he; yet he listen’d, plunged in thought</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore</span>
						<br/>
				<span>At the full moon; tears gather’d in his eyes;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For he remember’d his own early youth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A far, bright city, smitten by the sun,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through many rolling clouds⁠—so Rustum saw</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His youth; saw Sohrab’s mother, in her bloom;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And that old king, her father, who loved well</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They three, in that long-distant summer-time⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And hound, and morn on those delightful hills</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of age and looks to be his own dear son,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of an unskilful gardener has been cut,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the mown, dying grass⁠—so Sohrab lay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lovely in death, upon the common sand.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have told thee false⁠—thou art not Rustum’s son.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For Rustum had no son; one child he had⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But one⁠—a girl; who with her mother now</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Sohrab answer’d him in wrath; for now</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The anguish of the deep-fix’d spear grew fierce,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And he desired to draw forth the steel,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And let the blood flow free, and so to die⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But first he would convince his stubborn foe;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Truth sits upon the lips of dying men,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I tell thee, prick’d upon this arm I bear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That she might prick it on the babe she bore.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum’s cheeks,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And his knees totter’d, and he smote his hand</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Against his breast, his heavy mailed hand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That the hard iron corslet clank’d aloud;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And to his heart he press’d the other hand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And in a hollow voice he spake, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If thou show this, then art thou Rustum’s son.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And show’d a sign in faint vermilion points</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Prick’d; as a cunning workman, in Pekin,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>An emperor’s gift⁠—at early morn he paints,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So delicately prick’d the sign appear’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On Sohrab’s arm, the sign of Rustum’s seal.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It was that griffin, which of old rear’d Zal,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rustum’s great father, whom they left to die,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Him that kind creature found, and rear’d, and loved⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Sohrab bared that image on his arm,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And himself scann’d it long with mournful eyes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then he touch’d it with his hand and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“How say’st thou? Is that sign the proper sign</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Rustum’s son, or of some other man’s?”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Speechless; and then he utter’d one sharp cry:</span>
						<br/>
				<span><i>O boy⁠—thy father!</i>⁠—and his voice choked there.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then a dark cloud pass’d before his eyes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And his head swam, and he sank down to earth.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Sohrab crawl’d to where he lay, and cast</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His arms about his neck, and kiss’d his lips,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Trying to call him back to life; and life</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And they stood wide with horror; and he seized</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In both his hands the dust which lay around,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And threw it on his head, and smirch’d his hair⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And his sobs choked him; and he clutch’d his sword,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To draw it, and for ever let life out.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And with a soothing voice he spake, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The doom which at my birth was written down</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In Heaven, and thou art Heaven’s unconscious hand.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I know it! but fate trod those promptings down</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The strife, and hurl’d me on my father’s spear.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But let us speak no more of this! I find</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My father; let me feel that I have found!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And wash them with thy tears, and say: <i>My son!</i></span>
						<br/>
				<span>Quick! quick! for number’d are my sands of life,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And swift; for like the lightning to this field</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I came, and like the wind I go away⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But it was writ in Heaven that this should be.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So said he, and his voice released the heart</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His arms round his son’s neck, and wept aloud,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And kiss’d him. And awe fell on both the hosts,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When they saw Rustum’s grief; and Ruksh, the horse,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With his head bowing to the ground and mane</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe</span>
						<br/>
				<span>First to the one then to the other moved</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His head, as if inquiring what their grief</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The big warm tears roll’d down, and caked the sand.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Should first have rotted on their nimble joints,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or ere they brought thy master to this field!”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Sohrab look’d upon the horse and said;⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past days,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My terrible father’s terrible horse! and said,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That I should one day find thy lord and thee.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For thou hast gone where I shall never go,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And snuff’d the breezes of my father’s home.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And seen the River of Helmund, and the Lake</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Corn in a golden platter soak’d with wine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And said; <i>O Ruksh! bear Rustum well!</i>⁠—but I</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have never known my grandsire’s furrow’d face,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But lodged among my father’s foes, and seen</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Afrasiab’s cities only, Samarcand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewail’d:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Oh, that its waves were flowing over me!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Oh, that I saw its grains of yellow silt</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Roll tumbling in the current o’er my head!”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Desire not that, my father! thou must live.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For some are born to do great deeds, and live,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As some are born to be obscured, and die.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And reap a second glory in thine age;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But come! thou seest this great host of men</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let me entreat for them; what have they done?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They follow’d me, my hope, my fame, my star.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But carry me with thee to Seistan,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And place me on a bed, and mourn for me,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou, and the snow-hair’d Zal, and all thy friends.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And heap a stately mound above my bones,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And plant a far-seen pillar over all.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That so the passing horseman on the waste</span>
						<br/>
				<span>May see my tomb a great way off, and cry:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Sohrab, the mighty Rustum’s son, lies there,</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Whom his great father did in ignorance kill!</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I be not forgotten in my grave.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So shall it be; for I will burn my tents,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And carry thee away to Seistan,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I will lay thee in that lovely earth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And heap a stately mound above thy bones,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And plant a far-seen pillar over all,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And men shall not forget thee in thy grave.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I will spare thy host; yea, let them go!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What should I do with slaying any more?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For would that all that I have ever slain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Might be once more alive; my bitterest foes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And they who were call’d champions in their time,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And through whose death I won that fame I have⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I were nothing but a common man,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A poor, mean soldier, and without renown,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So thou mightest live too, my son, my son!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or rather would that I, even I myself,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Might now be lying on this bloody sand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not thou of mine! and I might die, not thou;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I, not thou, be borne to Seistan;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And say: <i>O son, I weep thee not too sore,</i></span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>For willingly, I know, thou met’st thine end!</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But now in blood and battles was my youth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And full of blood and battles is my age,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I shall never end this life of blood.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then, at the point of death, Sohrab replied:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Returning home over the salt blue sea,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From laying thy dear master in his grave.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Rustum gazed in Sohrab’s face, and said:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His wound’s imperious anguish; but the blood</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Came welling from the open gash, and life</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Flow’d with the stream;⁠—all down his cold white side</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The crimson torrent ran, dim now and soil’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like the soil’d tissue of white violets</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Left, freshly gather’d, on their native bank,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By children whom their nurses call with haste</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Indoors from the sun’s eye; his head droop’d low,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Convulsed him back to life, he open’d them,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And fix’d them feebly on his father’s face;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Till now all strength was ebb’d, and from his limbs</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Unwillingly the spirit fled away,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Regretting the warm mansion which it left,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the great Rustum drew his horseman’s cloak</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down o’er his face, and sate by his dead son.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As those black granite pillars, once high-rear’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His house, now ‘mid their broken flights of steps</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And night came down over the solemn waste,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And darken’d all; and a cold fog, with night,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As of a great assembly loosed, and fires</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Began to twinkle through the fog; for now</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Persians took it on the open sands</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Southward, the Tartars by the river marge;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Rustum and his son were left alone.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But the majestic river floated on,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Out of the mist and hum of that low land,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rejoicing, through the hush’d Chorasmian waste,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Under the solitary moon;⁠—he flow’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Right for the polar star, past Orgunjè,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And split his currents; that for many a league</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The shorn and parcell’d Oxus strains along</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A foil’d circuitous wanderer⁠—till at last</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The long’d-for dash of waves is heard, and wide</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His luminous home of waters opens, bright</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Emerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Go, for they call you, shepherd, from the hill;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Go, shepherd, and untie the wattled cotes!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No longer leave thy wistful flock unfed,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor let thy bawling fellows rack their throats,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor the cropp’d herbage shoot another head.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But when the fields are still,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the tired men and dogs all gone to rest,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And only the white sheep are sometimes seen</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cross and recross the strips of moon-blanch’d green,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come, shepherd, and again begin the quest!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here, where the reaper was at work of late⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In this high field’s dark corner, where he leaves</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His coat, his basket, and his earthen cruse,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And in the sun all morning binds the sheaves,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then here, at noon, comes back his stores to use⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here will I sit and wait,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>While to my ear from uplands far away</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The bleating of the folded flocks is borne,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With distant cries of reapers in the corn⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All the live murmur of a summer’s day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Screen’d is this nook o’er the high, half-reap’d field,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And here till sun-down, shepherd! will I be.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And round green roots and yellowing stalks I see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pale pink convolvulus in tendrils creep;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And air-swept lindens yield</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their scent, and rustle down their perfumed showers</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of bloom on the bent grass where I am laid,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And bower me from the August sun with shade;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the eye travels down to Oxford’s towers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And near me on the grass lies Glanvil’s book⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come, let me read the oft-read tale again!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The story of the Oxford scholar poor,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who, tired of knocking at preferment’s door,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>One summer-morn forsook</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His friends, and went to learn the gipsy-lore,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And roam’d the world with that wild brotherhood,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And came, as most men deem’d, to little good,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But came to Oxford and his friends no more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But once, years after, in the country-lanes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Two scholars, whom at college erst he knew,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Met him, and of his way of life enquired;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whereat he answer’d, that the gipsy-crew,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His mates, had arts to rule as they desired</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The workings of men’s brains,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And they can bind them to what thoughts they will.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“And I,” he said, “the secret of their art,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When fully learn’d, will to the world impart;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But it needs heaven-sent moments for this skill.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This said, he left them, and return’d no more.⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But rumours hung about the country-side,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That the lost Scholar long was seen to stray,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Seen by rare glimpses, pensive and tongue-tied,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In hat of antique shape, and cloak of grey,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The same the gipsies wore.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shepherds had met him on the Hurst in spring;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>At some lone alehouse in the Berkshire moors,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the warm ingle-bench, the smock-frock’d boors</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Had found him seated at their entering,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But, ‘mid their drink and clatter, he would fly.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I myself seem half to know thy looks,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And put the shepherds, wanderer! on thy trace;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And boys who in lone wheatfields scare the rooks</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I ask if thou hast pass’d their quiet place;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or in my boat I lie</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Moor’d to the cool bank in the summer-heats,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>‘Mid wide grass meadows which the sunshine fills,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And watch the warm, green-muffled Cumner hills,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And wonder if thou haunt’st their shy retreats.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For most, I know, thou lov’st retired ground!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thee at the ferry Oxford riders blithe,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Returning home on summer-nights, have met</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crossing the stripling Thames at Bab-lock-hithe,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As the punt’s rope chops round;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And leaning backward in a pensive dream,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pluck’d in shy fields and distant Wychwood bowers,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then they land, and thou art seen no more!⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Maidens, who from the distant hamlets come</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To dance around the Fyfield elm in May,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or cross a stile into the public way.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Oft thou hast given them store</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of flowers⁠—the frail-leaf’d, white anemony,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dark bluebells drench’d with dews of summer eves,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And purple orchises with spotted leaves⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But none hath words she can report of thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, above Godstow Bridge, when hay-time’s here</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In June, and many a scythe in sunshine flames,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Men who through those wide fields of breezy grass</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where black-wing’d swallows haunt the glittering Thames,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To bathe in the abandon’d lasher pass,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have often pass’d thee near</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sitting upon the river bank o’ergrown;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mark’d thine outlandish garb, thy figure spare,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thy dark vague eyes, and soft abstracted air⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, when they came from bathing, thou wast gone!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At some lone homestead in the Cumner hills,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where at her open door the housewife darns,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou hast been seen, or hanging on a gate</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To watch the threshers in the mossy barns.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Children, who early range these slopes and late</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For cresses from the rills,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have known thee eying, all an April-day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The springing pastures and the feeding kine;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And mark’d thee, when the stars come out and shine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through the long dewy grass move slow away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In autumn, on the skirts of Bagley Wood⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where most the gipsies by the turf-edged way</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pitch their smoked tents, and every bush you see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With scarlet patches tagg’d and shreds of grey,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Above the forest-ground called Thessaly⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The blackbird, picking food,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sees thee, nor stops his meal, nor fears at all;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So often has he known thee past him stray,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rapt, twirling in thy hand a wither’d spray,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And waiting for the spark from heaven to fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And once, in winter, on the causeway chill</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where home through flooded fields foot-travellers go,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have I not pass’d thee on the wooden bridge,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wrapt in thy cloak and battling with the snow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thy face tow’rd Hinksey and its wintry ridge?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thou hast climb’d the hill,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And gain’d the white brow of the Cumner range;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Turn’d once to watch, while thick the snowflakes fall,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The line of festal light in Christ-Church hall⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then sought thy straw in some sequester’d grange.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But what⁠—I dream! Two hundred years are flown</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Since first thy story ran through Oxford halls,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the grave Glanvil did the tale inscribe</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That thou wert wander’d from the studious walls</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To learn strange arts, and join a gipsy-tribe;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thou from earth art gone</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Long since, and in some quiet churchyard laid⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some country-nook, where o’er thy unknown grave</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tall grasses and white flowering nettles wave,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Under a dark, red-fruited yew-tree’s shade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—No, no, thou hast not felt the lapse of hours!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For what wears out the life of mortal men?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Tis that from change to change their being rolls;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Tis that repeated shocks, again, again,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Exhaust the energy of strongest souls</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And numb the elastic powers.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Till having used our nerves with bliss and teen,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And tired upon a thousand schemes our wit,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To the just-pausing Genius we remit</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our worn-out life, and are⁠—what we have been.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou hast not lived, why should’st thou perish, so?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou hadst <i>one</i> aim, <i>one</i> business, <i>one</i> desire;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Else wert thou long since number’d with the dead!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Else hadst thou spent, like other men, thy fire!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The generations of thy peers are fled,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And we ourselves shall go;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But thou possessest an immortal lot,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And we imagine thee exempt from age</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And living as thou liv’st on Glanvil’s page,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Because thou hadst⁠—what we, alas! have not.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For early didst thou leave the world, with powers</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fresh, undiverted to the world without,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Firm to their mark, not spent on other things;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which much to have tried, in much been baffled, brings.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O life unlike to ours!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who fluctuate idly without term or scope,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of whom each strives, nor knows for what he strives,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And each half lives a hundred different lives;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who wait like thee, but not, like thee, in hope.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou waitest for the spark from heaven! and we,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Light half-believers of our casual creeds,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who never deeply felt, nor clearly will’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose insight never has borne fruit in deeds,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose vague resolves never have been fulfill’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For whom each year we see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Breeds new beginnings, disappointments new;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who hesitate and falter life away,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And lose to-morrow the ground won to-day⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah! do not we, wanderer! await it too?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, we await it!⁠—but it still delays,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then we suffer! and amongst us one,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who most has suffer’d, takes dejectedly</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His seat upon the intellectual throne;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And all his store of sad experience he</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lays bare of wretched days;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tells us his misery’s birth and growth and signs,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And how the dying spark of hope was fed,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And how the breast was soothed, and how the head,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And all his hourly varied anodynes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This for our wisest! and we others pine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And wish the long unhappy dream would end,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And waive all claim to bliss, and try to bear;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With close-lipp’d patience for our only friend,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sad patience, too near neighbour to despair⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But none has hope like thine!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou through the fields and through the woods dost stray,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Roaming the country-side, a truant boy,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nursing thy project in unclouded joy,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And every doubt long blown by time away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O born in days when wits were fresh and clear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And life ran gaily as the sparkling Thames;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Before this strange disease of modern life,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With its sick hurry, its divided aims,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its heads o’ertax’d, its palsied hearts, was rife⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fly hence, our contact fear!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still fly, plunge deeper in the bowering wood!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Averse, as Dido did with gesture stern</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From her false friend’s approach in Hades turn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wave us away, and keep thy solitude!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still nursing the unconquerable hope,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still clutching the inviolable shade,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With a free, onward impulse brushing through,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By night, the silver’d branches of the glade⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Far on the forest-skirts, where none pursue,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On some mild pastoral slope</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Emerge, and resting on the moonlit pales</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Freshen thy flowers as in former years</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With dew, or listen with enchanted ears,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From the dark dingles, to the nightingales!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But fly our paths, our feverish contact fly!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For strong the infection of our mental strife,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which, though it gives no bliss, yet spoils for rest;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And we should win thee from thy own fair life,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like us distracted, and like us unblest.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Soon, soon thy cheer would die,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thy hopes grow timorous, and unfix’d thy powers,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thy clear aims be cross and shifting made;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And then thy glad perennial youth would fade,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fade, and grow old at last, and die like ours.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then fly our greetings, fly our speech and smiles!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—As some grave Tyrian trader, from the sea,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Descried at sunrise an emerging prow</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lifting the cool-hair’d creepers stealthily,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The fringes of a southward-facing brow</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Among the ægæan isles;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And saw the merry Grecian coaster come,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Freighted with amber grapes, and Chian wine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Green, bursting figs, and tunnies steep’d in brine⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And knew the intruders on his ancient home,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The young light-hearted masters of the waves⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And snatch’d his rudder, and shook out more sail;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And day and night held on indignantly</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O’er the blue Midland waters with the gale,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Betwixt the Syrtes and soft Sicily,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To where the Atlantic raves</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Outside the western straits; and unbent sails</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There, where down cloudy cliffs, through sheets of foam,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shy traffickers, the dark Iberians come;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And on the beach undid his corded bales.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">A DREAM</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Was it a dream? We sail’d, I thought we sail’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Martin and I, down a green Alpine stream,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Border’d, each bank, with pines; the morning sun,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the wet umbrage of their glossy tops,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the red pinings of their forest-floor,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Drew a warm scent abroad; behind the pines</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The mountain-skirts, with all their sylvan change</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of bright-leaf’d chestnuts and moss’d walnut-trees</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the frail scarlet-berried ash, began.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Swiss chalets glitter’d on the dewy slopes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And from some swarded shelf, high up, there came</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Notes of wild pastoral music⁠—over all</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ranged, diamond-bright, the eternal wall of snow.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Upon the mossy rocks at the stream’s edge,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Back’d by the pines, a plank-built cottage stood,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bright in the sun; the climbing gourd-plant’s leaves</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Muffled its walls, and on the stone-strewn roof</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lay the warm golden gourds; golden, within,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Under the eaves, peer’d rows of Indian corn.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We shot beneath the cottage with the stream.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the brown, rude-carved balcony, two forms</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Came forth⁠—Olivia’s, Marguerite! and thine.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Clad were they both in white, flowers in their breast;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Straw hats bedeck’d their heads, with ribbons blue,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which danced, and on their shoulders, fluttering, play’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They saw us, they conferr’d; their bosoms heaved,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And more than mortal impulse fill’d their eyes.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their lips moved; their white arms, waved eagerly,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Flash’d once, like falling streams; we rose, we gazed.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>One moment, on the rapid’s top, our boat</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hung poised⁠—and then the darting river of Life</span>
						<br/>
				<span>(Such now, methought, it was), the river of Life,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Loud thundering, bore us by; swift, swift it foam’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Black under cliffs it raced, round headlands shone.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Soon the plank’d cottage by the sun-warm’d pines</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Faded⁠—the moss⁠—the rocks; us burning plains,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bristled with cities, us the sea received.</span>

				<p>
					<span>So on the floor lay Balder dead; and round</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Lay thickly strewn swords, axes, darts, and spears,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which all the Gods in sport had idly thrown</span>
							<br/>
					<span>At Balder, whom no weapon pierced or clove;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But in his breast stood fixt the fatal bough</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of mistletoe, which Lok the Accuser gave</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To Hoder, and unwitting Hoder threw⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>’Gainst that alone had Balder’s life no charm.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And all the Gods and all the Heroes came,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And stood round Balder on the bloody floor,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Weeping and wailing; and Valhalla rang</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Up to its golden roof with sobs and cries;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And on the tables stood the untasted meats,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And in the horns and gold-rimm’d skulls the wine.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And now would night have fall’n, and found them yet</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Wailing; but otherwise was Odin’s will.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And thus the father of the ages spake:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Enough of tears, ye Gods, enough of wail!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Not to lament in was Valhalla made.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>If any here might weep for Balder’s death,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>I most might weep, his father; such a son</span>
							<br/>
					<span>I lose to-day, so bright, so loved a God.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But he has met that doom, which long ago</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The Nornies, when his mother bare him, spun,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And fate set seal, that so his end must be.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Balder has met his death, and ye survive⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Weep him an hour, but what can grief avail?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For ye yourselves, ye Gods, shall meet your doom,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>All ye who hear me, and inhabit Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And I too, Odin too, the Lord of all.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But ours we shall not meet, when that day comes,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With women’s tears and weak complaining cries⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Why should we meet another’s portion so?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Rather it fits you, having wept your hour,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With cold dry eyes, and hearts composed and stern,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To live, as erst, your daily life in Heaven.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>By me shall vengeance on the murderer Lok,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The foe, the accuser, whom, though Gods, we hate,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Be strictly cared for, in the appointed day.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Meanwhile, to-morrow, when the morning dawns,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Bring wood to the seashore to Balder’s ship,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And on the deck build high a funeral-pile,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And on the top lay Balder’s corpse, and put</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Fire to the wood, and send him out to sea</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To burn; for that is what the dead desire.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So spake the King of Gods, and straightway rose,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And mounted his horse Sleipner, whom he rode;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And from the hall of Heaven he rode away</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To Lidskialf, and sate upon his throne,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The mount, from whence his eye surveys the world.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And far from Heaven he turn’d his shining orbs</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To look on Midgard, and the earth, and men.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And on the conjuring Lapps he bent his gaze</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Whom antler’d reindeer pull over the snow;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And on the Finns, the gentlest of mankind,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Fair men, who live in holes under the ground;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor did he look once more to Ida’s plain,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor tow’rd Valhalla, and the sorrowing Gods;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For well he knew the Gods would heed his word,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And cease to mourn, and think of Balder’s pyre.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But in Valhalla all the Gods went back</span>
							<br/>
					<span>From around Balder, all the Heroes went;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And left his body stretch’d upon the floor.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And on their golden chairs they sate again,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Beside the tables, in the hall of Heaven;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And before each the cooks who served them placed</span>
							<br/>
					<span>New messes of the boar Serimner’s flesh,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the Valkyries crown’d their horns with mead.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So they, with pent-up hearts and tearless eyes,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Wailing no more, in silence ate and drank,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>While twilight fell, and sacred night came on.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But the blind Hoder left the feasting Gods</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In Odin’s hall, and went through Asgard streets,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And past the haven where the Gods have moor’d</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Their ships, and through the gate, beyond the wall;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Though sightless, yet his own mind led the God.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Down to the margin of the roaring sea</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He came, and sadly went along the sand,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Between the waves and black o’erhanging cliffs</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Where in and out the screaming seafowl fly;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Until he came to where a gully breaks</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Through the cliff-wall, and a fresh stream runs down</span>
							<br/>
					<span>From the high moors behind, and meets the sea.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>There, in the glen, Fensaler stands, the house</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Frea, honour’d mother of the Gods,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And shows its lighted windows to the main.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>There he went up, and pass’d the open doors;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And in the hall he found those women old,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The prophetesses, who by rite eterne</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On Frea’s hearth feed high the sacred fire</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Both night and day; and by the inner wall</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Upon her golden chair the Mother sate,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With folded hands, revolving things to come.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To her drew Hoder near, and spake, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Mother, a child of bale thou bar’st in me!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For, first, thou barest me with blinded eyes,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Sightless and helpless, wandering weak in Heaven;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And, after that, of ignorant witless mind</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thou barest me, and unforeseeing soul;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>That I alone must take the branch from Lok,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The foe, the accuser, whom, though Gods, we hate,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And cast it at the dear-loved Balder’s breast</span>
							<br/>
					<span>At whom the Gods in sport their weapons threw⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>’Gainst that alone had Balder’s life no charm.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Now therefore what to attempt, or whither fly,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For who will bear my hateful sight in Heaven?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Can I, O mother, bring them Balder back?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Or⁠—for thou know’st the fates, and things allow’d⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Can I with Hela’s power a compact strike,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And make exchange, and give my life for his?”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spoke: the mother of the Gods replied:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Hoder, ill-fated, child of bale, my son,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Sightless in soul and eye, what words are these?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>That one, long portion’d with his doom of death,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Should change his lot, and fill another’s life,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Hela yield to this, and let him go!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On Balder Death hath laid her hand, not thee;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor doth she count this life a price for that.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For many Gods in Heaven, not thou alone,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Would freely die to purchase Balder back,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And wend themselves to Hela’s gloomy realm.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For not so gladsome is that life in Heaven</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which Gods and heroes lead, in feast and fray,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Waiting the darkness of the final times,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>That one should grudge its loss for Balder’s sake,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Balder their joy, so bright, so loved a God.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But fate withstands, and laws forbid this way.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Yet in my secret mind one way I know,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor do I judge if it shall win or fail;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But much must still be tried, which shall but fail.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the blind Hoder answer’d her, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“What way is this, O mother, that thou show’st?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Is it a matter which a God might try?”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And straight the mother of the Gods replied:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“There is a road which leads to Hela’s realm,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Untrodden, lonely, far from light and Heaven.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who goes that way must take no other horse</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To ride, but Sleipner, Odin’s horse, alone.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor must he choose that common path of Gods</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which every day they come and go in Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>O’er the bridge Bifrost, where is Heimdall’s watch,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Past Midgard fortress, down to earth and men.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But he must tread a dark untravell’d road</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which branches from the north of Heaven, and ride</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nine days, nine nights, toward the northern ice,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Through valleys deep-engulph’d, with roaring streams.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And he will reach on the tenth morn a bridge</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which spans with golden arches Giall’s stream,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Not Bifrost, but that bridge a damsel keeps,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who tells the passing troops of dead their way</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To the low shore of ghosts, and Hela’s realm.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And she will bid him northward steer his course.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then he will journey through no lighted land,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor see the sun arise, nor see it set;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But he must ever watch the northern Bear,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who from her frozen height with jealous eye</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Confronts the Dog and Hunter in the south,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And is alone not dipt in Ocean’s stream.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And straight he will come down to Ocean’s strand⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Ocean, whose watery ring enfolds the world,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And on whose marge the ancient giants dwell.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But he will reach its unknown northern shore,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Far, far beyond the outmost giant’s home,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>At the chink’d fields of ice, the waste of snow.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And he must fare across the dismal ice</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Northward, until he meets a stretching wall</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Barring his way, and in the wall a grate.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But then he must dismount, and on the ice</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Tighten the girths of Sleipner, Odin’s horse,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And make him leap the grate, and come within.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And he will see stretch round him Hela’s realm,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The plains of Niflheim, where dwell the dead,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And hear the roaring of the streams of Hell.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And he will see the feeble, shadowy tribes,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Balder sitting crown’d, and Hela’s throne.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then must he not regard the wailful ghosts</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who all will flit, like eddying leaves, around;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But he must straight accost their solemn queen,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And pay her homage, and entreat with prayers,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Telling her all that grief they have in Heaven</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For Balder, whom she holds by right below;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>If haply he may melt her heart with words,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And make her yield, and give him Balder back.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>She spoke; but Hoder answer’d her and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Mother, a dreadful way is this thou show’st;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>No journey for a sightless God to go!”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And straight the mother of the Gods replied:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Therefore thyself thou shalt not go, my son.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But he whom first thou meetest when thou com’st</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To Asgard, and declar’st this hidden way,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Shall go; and I will be his guide unseen.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>She spoke, and on her face let fall her veil,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And bow’d her head, and sate with folded hands,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But at the central hearth those women old,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who while the Mother spake had ceased their toil,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Began again to heap the sacred fire.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Hoder turn’d, and left his mother’s house,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Fensaler, whose lit windows look to sea;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And came again down to the roaring waves,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And back along the beach to Asgard went,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Pondering on that which Frea said should be.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But night came down, and darken’d Asgard streets</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then from their loathéd feasts the Gods arose,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And lighted torches, and took up the corpse</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Balder from the floor of Odin’s hall,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And laid it on a bier, and bare him home</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Through the fast-darkening streets to his own house,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Breidablik, on whose columns Balder graved</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The enchantments that recall the dead to life.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For wise he was, and many curious arts,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Postures of runes, and healing herbs he knew;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Unhappy! but that art he did not know,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To keep his own life safe, and see the sun.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>There to his hall the Gods brought Balder home,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And each bespake him as he laid him down:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Would that ourselves, O Balder, we were borne</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Home to our halls, with torchlight, by our kin,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So thou might’st live, and still delight the Gods!”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>They spake; and each went home to his own house.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But there was one, the first of all the Gods</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For speed, and Hermod was his name in Heaven;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Most fleet he was, but now he went the last,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Heavy in heart for Balder, to his house,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which he in Asgard built him, there to dwell,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Against the harbour, by the city-wall.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Him the blind Hoder met, as he came up</span>
							<br/>
					<span>From the sea cityward, and knew his step;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor yet could Hermod see his brother’s face,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For it grew dark; but Hoder touch’d his arm.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And as a spray of honeysuckle flowers</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Brushes across a tired traveller’s face</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who shuffles through the deep dew-moisten’d dust,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On a May evening, in the darken’d lanes,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And starts him, that he thinks a ghost went by⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So Hoder brush’d by Hermod’s side, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Take Sleipner, Hermod, and set forth with dawn</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To Hela’s kingdom, to ask Balder back;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And they shall be thy guides, who have the power.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake, and brush’d soft by, and disappear’d.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Hermod gazed into the night, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Who is it utters through the dark his hest</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So quickly, and will wait for no reply?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The voice was like the unhappy Hoder’s voice.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Howbeit I will see, and do his hest;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For there rang note divine in that command.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So speaking, the fleet-footed Hermod came</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Home, and lay down to sleep in his own house;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And all the Gods lay down in their own homes.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Hoder too came home, distraught with grief,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Loathing to meet, at dawn, the other Gods;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And he went in, and shut the door, and fixt</span>
							<br/>
					<span>His sword upright, and fell on it, and died.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But from the hill of Lidskialf Odin rose,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The throne, from which his eye surveys the world;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And mounted Sleipner, and in darkness rode</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To Asgard. And the stars came out in heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>High over Asgard, to light home the King.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But fiercely Odin gallop’d, moved in heart;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And swift to Asgard, to the gate, he came.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And terribly the hoofs of Sleipner rang</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Along the flinty floor of Asgard streets,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the Gods trembled on their golden beds</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hearing the wrathful Father coming home⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For dread, for like a whirlwind, Odin came.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And to Valhalla’s gate he rode, and left</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Sleipner; and Sleipner went to his own stall;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And in Valhalla Odin laid him down.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But in Breidablik, Nanna, Balder’s wife,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Came with the Goddesses who wrought her will,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And stood by Balder lying on his bier.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And at his head and feet she station’d Scalds</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who in their lives were famous for their song;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>These o’er the corpse intoned a plaintive strain,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>A dirge⁠—and Nanna and her train replied.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And far into the night they wail’d their dirge.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But when their souls were satisfied with wail,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>They went, and laid them down, and Nanna went</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Into an upper chamber, and lay down;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Frea seal’d her tired lids with sleep.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And ’twas when night is bordering hard on dawn,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>When air is chilliest, and the stars sunk low;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then Balder’s spirit through the gloom drew near,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In garb, in form, in feature as he was,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Alive; and still the rays were round his head</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which were his glorious mark in Heaven; he stood</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Over against the curtain of the bed,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And gazed on Nanna as she slept, and spake:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Poor lamb, thou sleepest, and forgett’st thy woe!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Tears stand upon the lashes of thine eyes,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Tears wet the pillow by thy cheek; but thou,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Like a young child, hast cried thyself to sleep.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Sleep on; I watch thee, and am here to aid.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Alive I kept not far from thee, dear soul!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Neither do I neglect thee now, though dead.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For with to-morrow’s dawn the Gods prepare</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To gather wood, and build a funeral-pile</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Upon my ship, and burn my corpse with fire,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>That sad, sole honour of the dead; and thee</span>
							<br/>
					<span>They think to burn, and all my choicest wealth,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With me, for thus ordains the common rite.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But it shall not be so; but mild, but swift,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But painless shall a stroke from Frea come,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To cut thy thread of life, and free thy soul,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And they shall burn thy corpse with mine, not thee.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And well I know that by no stroke of death,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Tardy or swift, would’st thou be loath to die,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So it restored thee, Nanna, to my side,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Whom thou so well hast loved; but I can smooth</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thy way, and this, at least, my prayers avail.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Yes, and I fain would altogether ward</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Death from thy head, and with the Gods in Heaven</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Prolong thy life, though not by thee desired⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But right bars this, not only thy desire.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Yet dreary, Nanna, is the life they lead</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In that dim world, in Hela’s mouldering realm;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And doleful are the ghosts, the troops of dead,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Whom Hela with austere control presides.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For of the race of Gods is no one there,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Save me alone, and Hela, solemn queen;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And all the nobler souls of mortal men</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On battle-field have met their death, and now</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Feast in Valhalla, in my father’s hall;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Only the inglorious sort are there below,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The old, the cowards, and the weak are there⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Men spent by sickness, or obscure decay.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But even there, O Nanna, we might find</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Some solace in each other’s look and speech,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Wandering together through that gloomy world,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And talking of the life we led in Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>While we yet lived, among the other Gods.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake, and straight his lineaments began</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To fade; and Nanna in her sleep stretch’d out</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Her arms towards him with a cry⁠—but he</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Mournfully shook his head, and disappear’d.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And as the woodman sees a little smoke</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hang in the air, afield, and disappear,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So Balder faded in the night away.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Nanna on her bed sank back; but then</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Frea, the mother of the Gods, with stroke</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Painless and swift, set free her airy soul,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which took, on Balder’s track, the way below;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And instantly the sacred morn appear’d.</span>

					<span>Forth from the east, up the ascent of Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Day drove his courser with the shining mane;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And in Valhalla, from his gable-perch,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The golden-crested cock began to crow.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hereafter, in the blackest dead of night,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With shrill and dismal cries that bird shall crow,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Warning the Gods that foes draw nigh to Heaven;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But now he crew at dawn, a cheerful note,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To wake the Gods and Heroes to their tasks.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And all the Gods, and all the Heroes, woke.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And from their beds the Heroes rose, and donn’d</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Their arms, and led their horses from the stall,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And mounted them, and in Valhalla’s court</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Were ranged; and then the daily fray began.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And all day long they there are hack’d and hewn,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>‘Mid dust, and groans, and limbs lopp’d off, and blood;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But all at night return to Odin’s hall,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Woundless and fresh; such lot is theirs in Heaven.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the Valkyries on their steeds went forth</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Tow’rd earth and fights of men; and at their side</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Skulda, the youngest of the Nornies, rode;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And over Bifrost, where is Heimdall’s watch,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Past Midgard fortress, down to earth they came;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>There through some battle-field, where men fall fast,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Their horses fetlock-deep in blood, they ride,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And pick the bravest warriors out for death,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Whom they bring back with them at night to Heaven</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To glad the Gods, and feast in Odin’s hall.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But the Gods went not now, as otherwhile,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Into the tilt-yard, where the Heroes fought,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To feast their eyes with looking on the fray;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor did they to their judgment-place repair</span>
							<br/>
					<span>By the ash Igdrasil, in Ida’s plain,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Where they hold council, and give laws for men.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But they went, Odin first, the rest behind,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To the hall Gladheim, which is built of gold;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Where are in circle ranged twelve golden chairs,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And in the midst one higher, Odin’s throne.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>There all the Gods in silence sate them down;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And thus the Father of the ages spake:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Go quickly, Gods, bring wood to the seashore,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With all, which it beseems the dead to have,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And make a funeral-pile on Balder’s ship;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On the twelfth day the Gods shall burn his corpse.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But Hermod, thou, take Sleipner, and ride down</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To Hela’s kingdom, to ask Balder back.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So said he; and the Gods arose, and took</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Axes and ropes, and at their head came Thor,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Shouldering his hammer, which the giants know.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Forth wended they, and drave their steeds before.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And up the dewy mountain-tracks they fared</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To the dark forests, in the early dawn;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And up and down, and side and slant they roam’d.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And from the glens all day an echo came</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of crashing falls; for with his hammer Thor</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Smote ‘mid the rocks the lichen-bearded pines,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And burst their roots, while to their tops the Gods</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Made fast the woven ropes, and haled them down,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And lopp’d their boughs, and clove them on the sward,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And bound the logs behind their steeds to draw,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And drave them homeward; and the snorting steeds</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Went straining through the crackling brushwood down,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And by the darkling forest-paths the Gods</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Follow’d, and on their shoulders carried boughs.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And they came out upon the plain, and pass’d</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Asgard, and led their horses to the beach,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And loosed them of their loads on the seashore,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And ranged the wood in stacks by Balder’s ship;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And every God went home to his own house.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But when the Gods were to the forest gone,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hermod led Sleipner from Valhalla forth</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And saddled him; before that, Sleipner brook’d</span>
							<br/>
					<span>No meaner hand than Odin’s on his mane,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On his broad back no lesser rider bore;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Yet docile now he stood at Hermod’s side,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Arching his neck, and glad to be bestrode,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Knowing the God they went to seek, how dear.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But Hermod mounted him, and sadly fared</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In silence up the dark untravell’d road</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which branches from the north of Heaven, and went</span>
							<br/>
					<span>All day; and daylight waned, and night came on.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And all that night he rode, and journey’d so,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nine days, nine nights, toward the northern ice,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Through valleys deep-engulph’d, by roaring streams.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And on the tenth morn he beheld the bridge</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which spans with golden arches Giall’s stream,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And on the bridge a damsel watching arm’d,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In the strait passage, at the farther end,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Where the road issues between walling rocks.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Scant space that warder left for passers by;⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But as when cowherds in October drive</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Their kine across a snowy mountain-pass</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To winter-pasture on the southern side,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And on the ridge a waggon chokes the way,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Wedged in the snow; then painfully the hinds</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With goad and shouting urge their cattle past,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Plunging through deep untrodden banks of snow</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To right and left, and warm steam fills the air⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So on the bridge that damsel block’d the way,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And question’d Hermod as he came, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Who art thou on thy black and fiery horse</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Under whose hoofs the bridge o’er Giall’s stream</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Rumbles and shakes? Tell me thy race and home.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But yestermorn, five troops of dead pass’d by,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Bound on their way below to Hela’s realm,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor shook the bridge so much as thou alone.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And thou hast flesh and colour on thy cheeks,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Like men who live, and draw the vital air;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor look’st thou pale and wan, like men deceased,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Souls bound below, my daily passers here.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the fleet-footed Hermod answer’d her:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“O damsel, Hermod am I call’d, the son</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Odin; and my high-roof’d house is built</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Far hence, in Asgard, in the city of Gods;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Sleipner, Odin’s horse, is this I ride.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And I come, sent this road on Balder’s track;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Say then, if he hath cross’d thy bridge or no?”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake; the warder of the bridge replied:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“O Hermod, rarely do the feet of Gods</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Or of the horses of the Gods resound</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Upon my bridge; and, when they cross, I know.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Balder hath gone this way, and ta’en the road</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Below there, to the north, tow’rd Hela’s realm.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>From here the cold white mist can be discern’d,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor lit with sun, but through the darksome air</span>
							<br/>
					<span>By the dim vapour-blotted light of stars,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which hangs over the ice where lies the road.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For in that ice are lost those northern streams,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Freezing and ridging in their onward flow,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which from the fountain of Vergelmer run,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The spring that bubbles up by Hela’s throne.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>There are the joyless seats, the haunt of ghosts,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hela’s pale swarms; and there was Balder bound.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Ride on! pass free! but he by this is there.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>She spake, and stepp’d aside, and left him room.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Hermod greeted her, and gallop’d by</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Across the bridge; then she took post again.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But northward Hermod rode, the way below;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And o’er a darksome tract, which knows no sun,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But by the blotted light of stars, he fared.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And he came down to Ocean’s northern strand,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>At the drear ice, beyond the giants’ home.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thence on he journey’d o’er the fields of ice</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Still north, until he met a stretching wall</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Barring his way, and in the wall a grate.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then he dismounted, and drew tight the girths,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On the smooth ice, of Sleipner, Odin’s horse,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And made him leap the grate, and came within.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And he beheld spread round him Hela’s realm,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The plains of Niflheim, where dwell the dead,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And heard the thunder of the streams of Hell.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For near the wall the river of Roaring flows,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Outmost; the others near the centre run⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The Storm, the Abyss, the Howling, and the Pain;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>These flow by Hela’s throne, and near their spring.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And from the dark flock’d up the shadowy tribes;⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And as the swallows crowd the bulrush-beds</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of some clear river, issuing from a lake,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On autumn-days, before they cross the sea;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And to each bulrush-crest a swallow hangs</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Quivering, and others skim the river-streams,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And their quick twittering fills the banks and shores⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So around Hermod swarm’d the twittering ghosts.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Women, and infants, and young men who died</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Too soon for fame, with white ungraven shields;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And old men, known to glory, but their star</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Betray’d them, and of wasting age they died,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Not wounds; yet, dying, they their armour wore,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And now have chief regard in Hela’s realm.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Behind flock’d wrangling up a piteous crew,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Greeted of none, disfeatured and forlorn⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Cowards, who were in sloughs interr’d alive;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And round them still the wattled hurdles hung,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Wherewith they stamp’d them down, and trod them deep,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To hide their shameful memory from men.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But all he pass’d unhail’d, and reach’d the throne</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Hela, and saw, near it, Balder crown’d,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Hela set thereon, with countenance stern;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And thus bespake him first the solemn queen:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Unhappy, how hast thou endured to leave</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The light, and journey to the cheerless land</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Where idly flit about the feeble shades?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>How didst thou cross the bridge o’er Giall’s stream,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Being alive, and come to Ocean’s shore?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Or how o’erleap the grate that bars the wall?”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>She spake: but down off Sleipner Hermod sprang,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And fell before her feet, and clasp’d her knees;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And spake, and mild entreated her, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“O Hela, wherefore should the Gods declare</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Their errands to each other, or the ways</span>
							<br/>
					<span>They go? the errand and the way is known.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thou know’st, thou know’st, what grief we have in Heaven</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For Balder, whom thou hold’st by right below.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Restore him! for what part fulfils he here?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Shall he shed cheer over the cheerless seats,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And touch the apathetic ghosts with joy?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Not for such end, O queen, thou hold’st thy realm.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For Heaven was Balder born, the city of Gods</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Heroes, where they live in light and joy.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thither restore him, for his place is there!”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spoke; and grave replied the solemn queen:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Hermod, for he thou art, thou son of Heaven!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>A strange unlikely errand, sure, is thine.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Do the Gods send to me to make them blest?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Small bliss my race hath of the Gods obtained.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Three mighty children to my father Lok</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Did Angerbode, the giantess, bring forth⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Fenris the wolf, the Serpent huge, and me.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of these the Serpent in the sea ye cast,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who since in your despite hath wax’d amain,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And now with gleaming ring enfolds the world;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Me on this cheerless nether world ye threw,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And gave me nine unlighted realms to rule;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>While on his island in the lake afar,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Made fast to the bored crag, by wile not strength</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Subdued, with limber chains lives Fenris bound.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Lok still subsists in Heaven, our father wise,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Your mate, though loathed, and feasts in Odin’s hall;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But him too foes await, and netted snares,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And in a cave a bed of needle-rocks,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And o’er his visage serpents dropping gall.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Yet he shall one day rise, and burst his bonds,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And with himself set us his offspring free,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>When he guides Muspel’s children to their bourne.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Till then in peril or in pain we live,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Wrought by the Gods⁠—and ask the Gods our aid?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Howbeit, we abide our day; till then,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>We do not as some feebler haters do⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Seek to afflict our foes with petty pangs,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Helpless to better us, or ruin them.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Come then! if Balder was so dear beloved,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And this is true, and such a loss is Heaven’s⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hear, how to Heaven may Balder be restored.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Show me through all the world the signs of grief!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Fails but one thing to grieve, here Balder stops!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Let all that lives and moves upon the earth</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Weep him, and all that is without life weep;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Let Gods, men, brutes, beweep him; plants and stones!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So shall I know the lost was dear indeed,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And bend my heart, and give him back to Heaven.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>She spake; and Hermod answer’d her, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Hela, such as thou say’st, the terms shall be.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But come, declare me this, and truly tell:</span>
							<br/>
					<span>May I, ere I depart, bid Balder hail,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Or is it here withheld to greet the dead?”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake, and straightway Hela answered him:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Hermod, greet Balder if thou wilt, and hold</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Converse; his speech remains, though he be dead.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And straight to Balder Hermod turn’d, and spake:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Even in the abode of death, O Balder, hail!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thou hear’st, if hearing, like as speech, is thine,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The terms of thy releasement hence to Heaven;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Fear nothing but that all shall be fulfill’d.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For not unmindful of thee are the Gods,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who see the light, and blest in Asgard dwell;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Even here they seek thee out, in Hela’s realm.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And sure of all the happiest far art thou</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who ever have been known in earth or Heaven;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Alive, thou wast of Gods the most beloved,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And now thou sittest crown’d by Hela’s side,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Here, and hast honour among all the dead.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake; and Balder utter’d him reply,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But feebly, as a voice far off; he said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Hermod the nimble, gild me not my death!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Better to live a serf, a captured man,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who scatters rushes in a master’s hall,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Than be a crown’d king here, and rule the dead.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And now I count not of these terms as safe</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To be fulfill’d, nor my return as sure,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Though I be loved, and many mourn my death;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For double-minded ever was the seed</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Lok, and double are the gifts they give.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Howbeit, report thy message; and therewith,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To Odin, to my father, take this ring,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Memorial of me, whether saved or no;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And tell the Heaven-born Gods how thou hast seen</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Me sitting here below by Hela’s side,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Crown’d, having honour among all the dead.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake, and raised his hand, and gave the ring.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And with inscrutable regard the queen</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Hell beheld them, and the ghosts stood dumb.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But Hermod took the ring, and yet once more</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Kneel’d and did homage to the solemn queen;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then mounted Sleipner, and set forth to ride</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Back, through the astonish’d tribes of dead, to Heaven.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And to the wall he came, and found the grate</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Lifted, and issued on the fields of ice.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And o’er the ice he fared to Ocean’s strand,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And up from thence, a wet and misty road,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To the arm’d damsel’s bridge, and Giall’s stream.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Worse was that way to go than to return,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For him;⁠—for others all return is barr’d.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nine days he took to go, two to return,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And on the twelfth morn saw the light of Heaven.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And as a traveller in the early dawn</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To the steep edge of some great valley comes,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Through which a river flows, and sees, beneath,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Clouds of white rolling vapours fill the vale,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But o’er them, on the farther slope, descries</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Vineyards, and crofts, and pastures, bright with sun⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So Hermod, o’er the fog between, saw Heaven.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Sleipner snorted, for he smelt the air</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Heaven; and mightily, as wing’d, he flew.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Hermod saw the towers of Asgard rise;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And he drew near, and heard no living voice</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In Asgard; and the golden halls were dumb.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then Hermod knew what labour held the Gods;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And through the empty streets he rode, and pass’d</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Under the gate-house to the sands, and found</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The Gods on the sea-shore by Balder’s ship.</span>

				<p>
					<span>The Gods held talk together, group’d in knots,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Round Balder’s corpse, which they had thither borne;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Hermod came down tow’rds them from the gate.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Lok, the father of the serpent, first</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Beheld him come, and to his neighbour spake:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“See, here is Hermod, who comes single back</span>
							<br/>
					<span>From Hell; and shall I tell thee how he seems?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Like as a farmer, who hath lost his dog,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Some morn, at market, in a crowded town⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Through many streets the poor beast runs in vain,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And follows this man after that, for hours;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And, late at evening, spent and panting, falls</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Before a stranger’s threshold, not his home,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With flanks a-tremble, and his slender tongue</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hangs quivering out between his dust-smear’d jaws,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And piteously he eyes the passers by;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But home his master comes to his own farm,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Far in the country, wondering where he is⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So Hermod comes to-day unfollow’d home.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And straight his neighbour, moved with wrath, replied:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Deceiver! fair in form, but false in heart!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Enemy, mocker, whom, though Gods, we hate⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Peace, lest our father Odin hear thee gibe!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Would I might see him snatch thee in his hand,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And bind thy carcase, like a bale, with cords,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And hurl thee in a lake, to sink or swim!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>If clear from plotting Balder’s death, to swim;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But deep, if thou devisedst it, to drown,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And perish, against fate, before thy day.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So they two soft to one another spake.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But Odin look’d toward the land, and saw</span>
							<br/>
					<span>His messenger; and he stood forth, and cried.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Hermod came, and leapt from Sleipner down,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And in his father’s hand put Sleipner’s rein,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And greeted Odin and the Gods, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Odin, my father, and ye, Gods of Heaven!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Lo, home, having perform’d your will, I come.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Into the joyless kingdom have I been,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Below, and look’d upon the shadowy tribes</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of ghosts, and communed with their solemn queen;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And to your prayer she sends you this reply:</span>
							<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Show her through all the world the signs of grief!</i>
						
					</span>
							<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Fails but one thing to grieve, there Balder stops!</i>
						
					</span>
							<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Let Gods, men, brutes, beweep him; plants and stones:</i>
						
					</span>
							<br/>
					<span>
						<i>So shall she know your loss was dear indeed,</i>
						
					</span>
							<br/>
					<span><i>And bend her heart, and give you Balder back.</i>”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spoke; and all the Gods to Odin look’d;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And straight the Father of the ages said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Ye Gods, these terms may keep another day.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But now, put on your arms, and mount your steeds,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And in procession all come near, and weep</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Balder; for that is what the dead desire.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>When ye enough have wept, then build a pile</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of the heap’d wood, and burn his corpse with fire</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Out of our sight; that we may turn from grief,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And lead, as erst, our daily life in Heaven.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spoke, and the Gods arm’d; and Odin donn’d</span>
							<br/>
					<span>His dazzling corslet and his helm of gold,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And led the way on Sleipner; and the rest</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Follow’d, in tears, their father and their king.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And thrice in arms around the dead they rode,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Weeping; the sands were wetted, and their arms,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With their thick-falling tears⁠—so good a friend</span>
							<br/>
					<span>They mourn’d that day, so bright, so loved a God.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Odin came, and laid his kingly hands</span>
							<br/>
					<span>On Balder’s breast, and thus began the wail:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Farewell, O Balder, bright and loved, my son!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In that great day, the twilight of the Gods,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>When Muspel’s children shall beleaguer Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then we shall miss thy counsel and thy arm.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thou camest near the next, O warrior Thor!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Shouldering thy hammer, in thy chariot drawn,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Swaying the long-hair’d goats with silver’d rein;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And over Balder’s corpse these words didst say:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Brother, thou dwellest in the darksome land,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And talkest with the feeble tribes of ghosts,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Now, and I know not how they prize thee there⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But here, I know, thou wilt be miss’d and mourn’d.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For haughty spirits and high wraths are rife</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Among the Gods and Heroes here in Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>As among those whose joy and work is war;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And daily strifes arise, and angry words.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But from thy lips, O Balder, night or day,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Heard no one ever an injurious word</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To God or Hero, but thou keptest back</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The others, labouring to compose their brawls.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Be ye then kind, as Balder too was kind!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For we lose him, who smoothed all strife in Heaven.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake, and all the Gods assenting wail’d.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Freya next came nigh, with golden tears;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The loveliest Goddess she in Heaven, by all</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Most honour’d after Frea, Odin’s wife.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Her long ago the wandering Oder took</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To mate, but left her to roam distant lands;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Since then she seeks him, and weeps tears of gold.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Names hath she many; Vanadis on earth</span>
							<br/>
					<span>They call her, Freya is her name in Heaven;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>She in her hands took Balder’s head, and spake:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Balder, my brother, thou art gone a road</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Unknown and long, and haply on that way</span>
							<br/>
					<span>My long-lost wandering Oder thou hast met,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For in the paths of Heaven he is not found.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Oh, if it be so, tell him what thou wast</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To his neglected wife, and what he is,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And wring his heart with shame, to hear thy word!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For he, my husband, left me here to pine,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Not long a wife, when his unquiet heart</span>
							<br/>
					<span>First drove him from me into distant lands;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Since then I vainly seek him through the world,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And weep from shore to shore my golden tears,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But neither god nor mortal heeds my pain.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thou only, Balder, wast for ever kind,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To take my hand, and wipe my tears, and say:</span>
							<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Weep not, O Freya, weep no golden tears!</i>
						
					</span>
							<br/>
					<span>
						<i>One day the wandering Oder will return,</i>
						
					</span>
							<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Or thou wilt find him in thy faithful search</i>
						
					</span>
							<br/>
					<span>
						<i>On some great road, or resting in an inn,</i>
						
					</span>
							<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Or at a ford, or sleeping by a tree.</i>
						
					</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So Balder said;⁠—but Oder, well I know,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>My truant Oder I shall see no more</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To the world’s end; and Balder now is gone,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And I am left uncomforted in Heaven.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>She spake; and all the Goddesses bewail’d.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Last from among the Heroes one came near,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>No God, but of the hero-troop the chief⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Regner, who swept the northern sea with fleets,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And ruled o’er Denmark and the heathy isles,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Living; but Ella captured him and slew;⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>A king whose fame then fill’d the vast of Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Now time obscures it, and men’s later deeds.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He last approach’d the corpse, and spake, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Balder, there yet are many Scalds in Heaven</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Still left, and that chief Scald, thy brother Brage,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Whom we may bid to sing, though thou art gone.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And all these gladly, while we drink, we hear,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>After the feast is done, in Odin’s hall;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But they harp ever on one string, and wake</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Remembrance in our soul of wars alone,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Such as on earth we valiantly have waged,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And blood, and ringing blows, and violent death.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But when thou sangest, Balder, thou didst strike</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Another note, and, like a bird in spring,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thy voice of joyance minded us, and youth,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And wife, and children, and our ancient home.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Yes, and I, too, remember’d then no more</span>
							<br/>
					<span>My dungeon, where the serpents stung me dead,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor Ella’s victory on the English coast⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But I heard Thora laugh in Gothland Isle,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And saw my shepherdess, Aslauga, tend</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Her flock along the white Norwegian beach.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Tears started to mine eyes with yearning joy.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Therefore with grateful heart I mourn thee dead.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So Regner spake, and all the Heroes groan’d.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But now the sun had pass’d the height of Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And soon had all that day been spent in wail;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But then the Father of the ages said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Ye Gods, there well may be too much of wail!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Bring now the gather’d wood to Balder’s ship;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Heap on the deck the logs, and build the pyre.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But when the Gods and Heroes heard, they brought</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The wood to Balder’s ship, and built a pile,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Full the deck’s breadth, and lofty; then the corpse</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Balder on the highest top they laid,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With Nanna on his right, and on his left</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hoder, his brother, whom his own hand slew.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And they set jars of wine and oil to lean</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Against the bodies, and stuck torches near,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Splinters of pine-wood, soak’d with turpentine;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And brought his arms and gold, and all his stuff,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And slew the dogs who at his table fed,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And his horse, Balder’s horse, whom most he loved,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And placed them on the pyre, and Odin threw</span>
							<br/>
					<span>A last choice gift thereon, his golden ring.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The mast they fixt, and hoisted up the sails,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then they put fire to the wood; and Thor</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Set his stout shoulder hard against the stern</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To push the ship through the thick sand;⁠—sparks flew</span>
							<br/>
					<span>From the deep trench she plough’d, so strong a God</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Furrow’d it; and the water gurgled in.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the ship floated on the waves, and rock’d.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But in the hills a strong east-wind arose,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And came down moaning to the sea; first squalls</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Ran black o’er the sea’s face, then steady rush’d</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The breeze, and fill’d the sails, and blew the fire.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And wreathed in smoke the ship stood out to sea.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Soon with a roaring rose the mighty fire,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the pile crackled; and between the logs</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Sharp quivering tongues of flame shot out, and leapt,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Curling and darting, higher, until they lick’d</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The summit of the pile, the dead, the mast,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And ate the shrivelling sails; but still the ship</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Drove on, ablaze above her hull with fire.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the Gods stood upon the beach, and gazed.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And while they gazed, the sun went lurid down</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Into the smoke-wrapt sea, and night came on.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then the wind fell, with night, and there was calm;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But through the dark they watch’d the burning ship</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Still carried o’er the distant waters on,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Farther and farther, like an eye of fire.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And long, in the far dark, blazed Balder’s pile;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But fainter, as the stars rose high, it flared,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The bodies were consumed, ash choked the pile.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And as, in a decaying winter-fire,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>A charr’d log, falling, makes a shower of sparks⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So with a shower of sparks the pile fell in,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Reddening the sea around; and all was dark.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But the Gods went by starlight up the shore</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To Asgard, and sate down in Odin’s hall</span>
							<br/>
					<span>At table, and the funeral-feast began.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>All night they ate the boar Serimner’s flesh,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And from their horns, with silver rimm’d, drank mead,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Silent, and waited for the sacred morn.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And morning over all the world was spread.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then from their loathéd feasts the Gods arose,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And took their horses, and set forth to ride</span>
							<br/>
					<span>O’er the bridge Bifrost, where is Heimdall’s watch,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To the ash Igdrasil, and Ida’s plain;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thor came on foot, the rest on horseback rode.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And they found Mimir sitting by his fount</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of wisdom, which beneath the ashtree springs;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And saw the Nornies watering the roots</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of that world-shadowing tree with honey-dew.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>There came the Gods, and sate them down on stones;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And thus the Father of the ages said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Ye Gods, the terms ye know, which Hermod brought.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Accept them or reject them! both have grounds.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Accept them, and they bind us, unfulfill’d,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To leave for ever Balder in the grave,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>An unrecover’d prisoner, shade with shades.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But how, ye say, should the fulfilment fail?⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Smooth sound the terms, and light to be fulfill’d;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For dear-beloved was Balder while he lived</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In Heaven and earth, and who would grudge him tears?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But from the traitorous seed of Lok they come,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>These terms, and I suspect some hidden fraud.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Bethink ye, Gods, is there no other way?⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Speak, were not this a way, the way for Gods?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>If I, if Odin, clad in radiant arms,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Mounted on Sleipner, with the warrior Thor</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Drawn in his car beside me, and my sons,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>All the strong brood of Heaven, to swell my train,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Should make irruption into Hela’s realm,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And set the fields of gloom ablaze with light,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And bring in triumph Balder back to Heaven?”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake, and his fierce sons applauded loud.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But Frea, mother of the Gods, arose,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Daughter and wife of Odin; thus she said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Odin, thou whirlwind, what a threat is this!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thou threatenest what transcends thy might, even thine.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For of all powers the mightiest far art thou,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Lord over men on earth, and Gods in Heaven;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Yet even from thee thyself hath been withheld</span>
							<br/>
					<span>One thing⁠—to undo what thou thyself hast ruled.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For all which hath been fixt, was fixt by thee.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In the beginning, ere the Gods were born,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Before the Heavens were builded, thou didst slay</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The giant Ymir, whom the abyss brought forth,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thou and thy brethren fierce, the sons of Bor,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And cast his trunk to choke the abysmal void.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But of his flesh and members thou didst build</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The earth and Ocean, and above them Heaven.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And from the flaming world, where Muspel reigns,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thou sent’st and fetched’st fire, and madest lights,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Sun, moon, and stars, which thou hast hung in Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Dividing clear the paths of night and day.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Asgard thou didst build, and Midgard fort;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then me thou mad’st; of us the Gods were born.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Last, walking by the sea, thou foundest spars</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of wood, and framed’st men, who till the earth,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Or on the sea, the field of pirates, sail.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And all the race of Ymir thou didst drown,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Save one, Bergelmer;⁠—he on shipboard fled</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thy deluge, and from him the giants sprang.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But all that brood thou hast removed far off,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And set by Ocean’s utmost marge to dwell;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But Hela into Niflheim thou threw’st,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And gav’st her nine unlighted worlds to rule,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>A queen, and empire over all the dead.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>That empire wilt thou now invade, light up</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Her darkness, from her grasp a subject tear?⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Try it; but I, for one, will not applaud.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor do I merit, Odin, thou should’st slight</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Me and my words, though thou be first in Heaven;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For I too am a Goddess, born of thee,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thine eldest, and of me the Gods are sprung;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And all that is to come I know, but lock</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In mine own breast, and have to none reveal’d.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Come then! since Hela holds by right her prey,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But offers terms for his release to Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Accept the chance; thou canst no more obtain.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Send through the world thy messengers; entreat</span>
							<br/>
					<span>All living and unliving things to weep</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For Balder; if thou haply thus may’st melt</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hela, and win the loved one back to Heaven.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>She spake, and on her face let fall her veil,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And bow’d her head, and sate with folded hands.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor did the all-ruling Odin slight her word;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Straightway he spake, and thus address’d the Gods:</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Go quickly forth through all the world, and pray</span>
							<br/>
					<span>All living and unliving things to weep</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Balder, if haply he may thus be won.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>When the Gods heard, they straight arose, and took</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Their horses, and rode forth through all the world;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>North, south, east, west, they struck, and roam’d the world,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Entreating all things to weep Balder’s death.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And all that lived, and all without life, wept.</span>
							<br/>
							<br/>
					<span>And as in winter, when the frost breaks up,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>At winter’s end, before the spring begins,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And a warm west-wind blows, and thaw sets in⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>After an hour a dripping sound is heard</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In all the forests, and the soft-strewn snow</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Under the trees is dibbled-thick with holes,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And from the boughs the snowloads shuffle down;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And, in fields sloping to the south, dark plots</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of grass peep out amid surrounding snow,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And widen, and the peasant’s heart is glad⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So through the world was heard a dripping noise</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of all things weeping to bring Balder back;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And there fell joy upon the Gods to hear.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But Hermod rode with Niord, whom he took</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To show him spits and beaches of the sea</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Far off, where some unwarn’d might fail to weep⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Niord, the God of storms, whom fishers know;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Not born in Heaven; he was in Vanheim rear’d,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>With men, but lives a hostage with the Gods;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He knows each frith, and every rocky creek</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Fringed with dark pines, and sands where seafowl scream⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>They two scour’d every coast, and all things wept.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And they rode home together, through the wood</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Jarnvid, which to east of Midgard lies</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Bordering the giants, where the trees are iron;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>There in the wood before a cave they came,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Where sate, in the cave’s mouth, a skinny hag,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Toothless and old; she gibes the passers by.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thok is she call’d, but now Lok wore her shape;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>She greeted them the first, and laugh’d, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Ye Gods, good lack, is it so dull in Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>That ye come pleasuring to Thok’s iron wood?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Lovers of change ye are, fastidious sprites.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Look, as in some boor’s yard a sweet-breath’d cow,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Whose manger is stuff’d full of good fresh hay,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Snuffs at it daintily, and stoops her head</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To chew the straw, her litter, at her feet⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So ye grow squeamish, Gods, and sniff at Heaven!”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>She spake; but Hermod answer’d her and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Thok, not for gibes we come, we come for tears.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Balder is dead, and Hela holds her prey,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But will restore, if all things give him tears.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Begrudge not thine! to all was Balder dear.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then, with a louder laugh, the hag replied:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Is Balder dead? and do ye come for tears?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thok with dry eyes will weep o’er Balder’s pyre.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Weep him all other things, if weep they will⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>I weep him not! let Hela keep her prey.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>She spake, and to the cavern’s depth she fled,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Mocking; and Hermod knew their toil was vain.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And as seafaring men, who long have wrought</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In the great deep for gain, at last come home,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And towards evening see the headlands rise</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of their dear country, and can plain descry</span>
							<br/>
					<span>A fire of wither’d furze which boys have lit</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Upon the cliffs, or smoke of burning weeds</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Out of a till’d field inland;⁠—then the wind</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Catches them, and drives out again to sea;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And they go long days tossing up and down</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Over the grey sea-ridges, and the glimpse</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of port they had makes bitterer far their toil⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So the Gods’ cross was bitterer for their joy.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then, sad at heart, to Niord Hermod spake:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“It is the accuser Lok, who flouts us all!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Ride back, and tell in Heaven this heavy news;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>I must again below, to Hela’s realm.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spoke; and Niord set forth back to Heaven.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But northward Hermod rode, the way below,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The way he knew; and traversed Giall’s stream,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And down to Ocean groped, and cross’d the ice,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And came beneath the wall, and found the grate</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Still lifted; well was his return foreknown.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And once more Hermod saw around him spread</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The joyless plains, and heard the streams of Hell.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But as he enter’d, on the extremest bound</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Niflheim, he saw one ghost come near,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hovering, and stopping oft, as if afraid⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hoder, the unhappy, whom his own hand slew.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Hermod look’d, and knew his brother’s ghost,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And call’d him by his name, and sternly said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Hoder, ill-fated, blind in heart and eyes!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Why tarriest thou to plunge thee in the gulph</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of the deep inner gloom, but flittest here,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In twilight, on the lonely verge of Hell,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Far from the other ghosts, and Hela’s throne?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Doubtless thou fearest to meet Balder’s voice,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thy brother, whom through folly thou didst slay.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spoke; but Hoder answer’d him, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Hermod the nimble, dost thou still pursue</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The unhappy with reproach, even in the grave?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For this I died, and fled beneath the gloom,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Not daily to endure abhorring Gods,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Nor with a hateful presence cumber Heaven;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And canst thou not, even here, pass pitying by?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>No less than Balder have I lost the light</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Heaven, and communion with my kin;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>I too had once a wife, and once a child,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And substance, and a golden house in Heaven⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But all I left of my own act, and fled</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Below, and dost thou hate me even here?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Balder upbraids me not, nor hates at all,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Though he has cause, have any cause; but he,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>When that with downcast looks I hither came,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Stretch’d forth his hand, and with benignant voice,</span>
							<br/>
					<span><i>Welcome</i>, he said, <i>if there be welcome here,</i></span>
							<br/>
					<span>
						<i>Brother and fellow-sport of Lok with me!</i>
						
					</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And not to offend thee, Hermod, nor to force</span>
							<br/>
					<span>My hated converse on thee, came I up</span>
							<br/>
					<span>From the deep gloom, where I will now return;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But earnestly I long’d to hover near,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Not too far off, when that thou camest by;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To feel the presence of a brother God,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And hear the passage of a horse of Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For the last time⁠—for here thou com’st no more.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake, and turn’d to go to the inner gloom.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But Hermod stay’d him with mild words, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Thou doest well to chide me, Hoder blind!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Truly thou say’st, the planning guilty mind</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Was Lok’s; the unwitting hand alone was thine.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But Gods are like the sons of men in this⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>When they have woe, they blame the nearest cause.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Howbeit stay, and be appeased! and tell:</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Sits Balder still in pomp by Hela’s side,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Or is he mingled with the unnumber’d dead?”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the blind Hoder answer’d him and spake:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“His place of state remains by Hela’s side,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But empty; for his wife, for Nanna came</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Lately below, and join’d him; and the pair</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Frequent the still recesses of the realm</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Hela, and hold converse undisturb’d.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But they too, doubtless, will have breathed the balm,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Which floats before a visitant from Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And have drawn upward to this verge of Hell.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake; and, as he ceased, a puff of wind</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Roll’d heavily the leaden mist aside</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Round where they stood, and they beheld two forms</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Make toward them o’er the stretching cloudy plain.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Hermod straight perceived them, who they were</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Balder and Nanna; and to Balder said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Balder, too truly thou foresaw’st a snare!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Lok triumphs still, and Hela keeps her prey.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>No more to Asgard shalt thou come, nor lodge</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In thy own house, Breidablik, nor enjoy</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The love all bear toward thee, nor train up</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Forset, thy son, to be beloved like thee.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Here must thou lie, and wait an endless age.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Therefore for the last time, O Balder, hail!”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake; and Balder answer’d him, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Hail and farewell! for here thou com’st no more.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Yet mourn not for me, Hermod, when thou sitt’st</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In Heaven, nor let the other Gods lament,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>As wholly to be pitied, quite forlorn.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For Nanna hath rejoin’d me, who, of old,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In Heaven, was seldom parted from my side;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And still the acceptance follows me, which crown’d</span>
							<br/>
					<span>My former life, and cheers me even here.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The iron frown of Hela is relax’d</span>
							<br/>
					<span>When I draw nigh, and the wan tribes of dead</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Love me, and gladly bring for my award</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Their ineffectual feuds and feeble hates⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Shadows of hates, but they distress them still.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the fleet-footed Hermod made reply:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Thou hast then all the solace death allows,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Esteem and function; and so far is well.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Yet here thou liest, Balder, underground,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Rusting for ever; and the years roll on,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The generations pass, the ages grow,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And bring us nearer to the final day</span>
							<br/>
					<span>When from the south shall march the fiery band</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And cross the bridge of Heaven, with Lok for guide,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Fenris at his heel with broken chain;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>While from the east the giant Rymer steers</span>
							<br/>
					<span>His ship, and the great serpent makes to land;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And all are marshall’d in one flaming square</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Against the Gods, upon the plains of Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>I mourn thee, that thou canst not help us then.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake; but Balder answer’d him, and said:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Mourn not for me! Mourn, Hermod, for the Gods;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Mourn for the men on earth, the Gods in Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who live, and with their eyes shall see that day!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The day will come, when fall shall Asgard’s towers,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And Odin, and his sons, the seed of Heaven;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But what were I, to save them in that hour?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>If strength might save them, could not Odin save,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>My father, and his pride, the warrior Thor,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Vidar the silent, the impetuous Tyr?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>I, what were I, when these can nought avail?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Yet, doubtless, when the day of battle comes,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the two hosts are marshall’d, and in Heaven</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The golden-crested cock shall sound alarm,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And his black brother-bird from hence reply,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And bucklers clash, and spears begin to pour⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Longing will stir within my breast, though vain.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But not to me so grievous, as, I know,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To other Gods it were, is my enforced</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Absence from fields where I could nothing aid;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>For I am long since weary of your storm</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of carnage, and find, Hermod, in your life</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Something too much of war and broils, which make</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Life one perpetual fight, a bath of blood.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Mine eyes are dizzy with the arrowy hail;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Mine ears are stunn’d with blows, and sick for calm.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Inactive therefore let me lie, in gloom,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Unarm’d, inglorious; I attend the course</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of ages, and my late return to light,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In times less alien to a spirit mild,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>In new-recover’d seats, the happier day.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spake; and the fleet Hermod thus replied:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Brother, what seats are these, what happier day?</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Tell me, that I may ponder it when gone.”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And the ray-crowned Balder answer’d him:⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>“Far to the south, beyond the blue, there spreads</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Another Heaven, the boundless⁠—no one yet</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hath reach’d it; there hereafter shall arise</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The second Asgard, with another name.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thither, when o’er this present earth and Heavens</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The tempest of the latter days hath swept,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And they from sight have disappear’d, and sunk,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Shall a small remnant of the Gods repair;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Hoder and I shall join them from the grave.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>There re-assembling we shall see emerge</span>
							<br/>
					<span>From the bright Ocean at our feet an earth</span>
							<br/>
					<span>More fresh, more verdant than the last, with fruits</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Self-springing, and a seed of man preserved,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Who then shall live in peace, as now in war.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But we in Heaven shall find again with joy</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The ruin’d palaces of Odin, seats</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Familiar, halls where we have supp’d of old;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Re-enter them with wonder, never fill</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Our eyes with gazing, and rebuild with tears.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And we shall tread once more the well-known plain</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Ida, and among the grass shall find</span>
							<br/>
					<span>The golden dice wherewith we play’d of yore;</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And that will bring to mind the former life</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And pastime of the Gods, the wise discourse</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Of Odin, the delights of other days,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>O Hermod, pray that thou may’st join us then!</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Such for the future is my hope; meanwhile,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>I rest the thrall of Hela, and endure</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Death, and the gloom which round me even now</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Thickens, and to its inner gulph recalls.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Farewell, for longer speech is not allow’d!”</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He spoke, and waved farewell, and gave his hand</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To Nanna; and she gave their brother blind</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Her hand, in turn, for guidance; and the three</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Departed o’er the cloudy plain, and soon</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Faded from sight into the interior gloom.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>But Hermod stood beside his drooping horse,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Mute, gazing after them in tears; and fain,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Fain had he follow’d their receding steps,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Though they to death were bound, and he to Heaven,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Then; but a power he could not break withheld.</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And as a stork which idle boys have trapp’d,</span>
							<br/>
					<span>And tied him in a yard, at autumn sees</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Flocks of his kind pass flying o’er his head</span>
							<br/>
					<span>To warmer lands, and coasts that keep the sun;⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>He strains to join their flight, and from his shed</span>
							<br/>
					<span>Follows them with a long complaining cry⁠—</span>
							<br/>
					<span>So Hermod gazed, and yearn’d to join his kin.</span>
							<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last he sigh’d, and set forth back to Heaven.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Where, under Loughrigg, the stream</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Rotha sparkles through fields</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Vested for ever with green,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Four years since, in the house</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of a gentle spirit, now dead⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wordsworth’s son-in-law, friend⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I saw the meeting of two</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gifted women.<a id="FNanchor_22_24" name="FNanchor_22_24"/><a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_22_24">[22]</a> The one,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Brilliant with recent renown,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Young, unpractised, had told</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With a master’s accent her feign’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Story of passionate life;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The other, maturer in fame,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Earning, she too, her praise</span>
						<br/>
				<span>First in fiction, had since</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Widen’d her sweep, and survey’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>History, politics, mind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The two held converse; they wrote</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In a book which of world-famous souls</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Kept the memorial;⁠—bard,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Warrior, statesman, had sign’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their names; chief glory of all,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Scott had bestow’d there his last</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Breathings of song, with a pen</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tottering, a death-stricken hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hope at that meeting smiled fair.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Years in number, it seem’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lay before both, and a fame</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heighten’d, and multiplied power.⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Behold! The elder, to-day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lies expecting from death,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In mortal weakness, a last</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Summons! the younger is dead!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>First to the living we pay</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mournful homage;⁠—the Muse</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gains not an earth-deafen’d ear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hail to the steadfast soul,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which, unflinching and keen,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wrought to erase from its depth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mist and illusion and fear!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hail to the spirit which dared</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Trust its own thoughts, before yet</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Echoed her back by the crowd!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hail to the courage which gave</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Voice to its creed, ere the creed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Won consecration from time!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Turn we next to the dead.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—How shall we honour the young,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The ardent, the gifted? how mourn?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Console we cannot, her ear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is deaf. Far northward from here,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In a churchyard high ‘mid the moors</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Yorkshire, a little earth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stops it for ever to praise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where, behind Keighley, the road</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Up to the heart of the moors</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Between heath-clad showery hills</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Runs, and colliers’ carts</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Poach the deep ways coming down,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And a rough, grimed race have their homes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There on its slope is built</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The moorland town. But the church</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stands on the crest of the hill,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lonely and bleak;⁠—at its side</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The parsonage-house and the graves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Strew with laurel the grave</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the early-dying! Alas,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Early she goes on the path</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To the silent country, and leaves</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Half her laurels unwon,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dying too soon!⁠—yet green</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Laurels she had, and a course</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Short, but redoubled by fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And not friendless, and not</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Only with strangers to meet,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Faces ungreeting and cold,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou, O mourn’d one, to-day</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Enterest the house of the grave!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Those of thy blood, whom thou lov’dst,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have preceded thee⁠—young,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Loving, a sisterly band;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some in art, some in gift</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Inferior⁠—all in fame.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They, like friends, shall receive</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This comer, greet her with joy;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Welcome the sister, the friend;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hear with delight of thy fame!</span>

			<h3>STORY OF THE DRAMA</h3>
			<div class="blockquot">
				<p>Apollodorus says:⁠—“Cresphontes had not reigned long in Messenia when he was murdered, together with two of his sons. And Polyphontes reigned in his stead, he, too, being of the family of Hercules; and he had for his wife, against her will, Merope, the widow of the murdered king. But Merope had borne to Cresphontes a third son, called æpytus; him she gave to her own father to bring up. He, when he came to man’s estate, returned secretly to Messenia, and slew Polyphontes and the other murderers of his father.”</p>
				<p>Hyginus says:⁠—“Merope sent away and concealed her infant son. Polyphontes sought for him everywhere in vain. He, when he grew up, laid a plan to avenge the murder of his father and brothers. In pursuance of this plan he came to king Polyphontes and reported the death of the son of Cresphontes and Merope. The king ordered him to be hospitably entertained, intending to inquire further of him. He, being very tired, went to sleep, and an old man, who was the channel through whom the mother and son used to communicate, arrives at this moment in tears, bringing word to Merope that her son had disappeared from his protector’s house, and was slain. Merope, believing that the sleeping stranger is the murderer of her son, comes into the guest-chamber with an axe, not knowing that he whom she would slay was her son; the old man recognised him, and withheld Merope from slaying him. The king, Polyphontes, rejoicing at the supposed death of æpytus, celebrated a sacrifice; his guest, pretending to strike the sacrificial victim, slew the king, and so got back his father’s kingdom.”</p>
			</div>
			<p>The events on which the action of the drama turns belong to the period of transition from the heroic and fabulous to the human and historic age of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348" name="Page_348">[348]</a></span> Greece. The doings of the hero Hercules, the ancestor of the Messenian æpytus, belong to fable; but the invasion of Peloponnesus by the Dorians under chiefs claiming to be descended from Hercules, and their settlement in Argos, Lacedæmon, and Messenia, belong to history. æpytus is descended on the father’s side from Hercules, Perseus, and the kings of Argos; on the mother’s side from Pelasgus, and the aboriginal kings of Arcadia. Callisto, the daughter of the wicked Lycaon, and the mother, by Zeus, of Arcas, from whom the Arcadians took their name, was the granddaughter of Pelasgus. The birth of Arcas brought upon Callisto the anger of the virgin-goddess Artemis, whose service she followed: she was changed into a she-bear, and in this form was chased by her own son, grown to manhood. Zeus interposed, and the mother and son were removed from the earth, and placed among the stars. Callisto became the famous constellation of the Great Bear; her son became Arcturus, Arctophylax, or Boötes. From this son of Callisto were descended Cypselus, the maternal grandfather of æpytus, and the children of Cypselus, Laias and Merope.</p>
			<p>The story of the life of Hercules, the paternal ancestor of æpytus, is so well known that there is no need to record it. The reader will remember that, although entitled to the throne of Argos by right of descent from Perseus and Danaus, and to the thrones of Sparta and Messenia by right of conquest, Hercules yet passed his life in labours and wanderings, subjected by the decree of fate to the commands of his kinsman, the feeble and malignant Eurystheus. At his death he bequeathed to his offspring, the Heracleidæ, his own claims to the kingdoms of Peloponnesus, and to the persecution of Eurystheus. They at first sought shelter with Ceyx, king of Trachis; he was too weak to protect them, and they then took refuge at Athens. The Athenians refused to deliver them up at the demand of Eurystheus; he invaded Attica, and a battle was fought near Marathon, in which, after Macaria, a daughter of Hercules, had devoted herself for the preservation of her house, Eurystheus fell, and the Heracleidæ and their Athenian protectors were victorious. The memory of Macaria’s self-sacrifices was perpetuated by the name of a spring of water on the plain of Marathon, the spring Macaria. The Heracleidæ then endeavoured to effect their return to Peloponnesus. Hyllus, the eldest of them, inquired of the oracle at Delphi respecting their return; he was told to return by the <i>narrow passage</i> and in the <i>third harvest</i>. Accordingly, in the third year from that time Hyllus led an army to the Isthmus of Corinth; but there he was encountered by an army of Achaians and Arcadians, and fell in single combat with Echemus, king of Tegea. Upon this defeat the Heracleidæ retired to northern Greece; there, after much wandering, they finally took refuge with ægimius, king of the Dorians, who appears to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349" name="Page_349">[349]</a></span> been the fastest friend of their house, and whose Dorian warriors formed the army which at last achieved their return. But, for a hundred years from the date of their first attempt, the Heracleidæ were defeated in their successive invasions of Peloponnesus. Cleolaus and Aristomachus, the son and grandson of Hyllus, fell in unsuccessful expeditions. At length the sons of Aristomachus, Temenus, Cresphontes, and Aristodemus, when grown up, repaired to Delphi and taxed the oracle with the non-fulfilment of the promise made to their ancestor Hyllus. But Apollo replied that his oracle had been misunderstood; for that by the <i>third harvest</i> he had meant the third generation, and by the <i>narrow passage</i> he had meant the straits of the Corinthian Gulf. After this explanation the sons of Aristomachus built a fleet at Naupactus; and finally, in the hundredth year from the death of Hyllus and the eightieth from the fall of Troy, the invasion was again attempted and was this time successful. The son of Orestes, Tisamenus, who ruled both Argos and Lacedæmon, fell in battle; many of his vanquished subjects left their homes and took refuge in Achaia.</p>
			<p>The spoil was now to be divided among the conquerors. Aristodemus, the youngest of the sons of Aristomachus, did not survive to enjoy his share. He was slain at Delphi by the sons of Pylades and Electra, the kinsman, through their mother, of the house of Agamemnon, that house which the Heracleidæ with their Dorian army had dispossessed. The claims of Aristodemus descended to his two sons, Procles and Eurysthenes, children under the guardianship of their maternal uncle, Theras. Temenus, the eldest of the sons of Aristomachus, took the kingdom of Argos. For the two remaining kingdoms, that of Sparta and that of Messenia, his two nephews, who were to rule jointly, and their uncle Cresphontes, had to cast lots. Cresphontes wished to have the fertile Messenia, and induced his brother to acquiesce in a trick which secured it to him. The lot of Cresphontes and that of his two nephews were to be placed in a water-jar, and thrown out. Messenia was to belong to him whose lot came out first. With the connivance of Temenus, Cresphontes marked as his own lot a pellet composed of baked clay, as the lot of his nephews, a pellet of unbaked clay; the unbaked pellet was of course dissolved in the water, while the brick pellet fell out alone. Messenia, therefore, was assigned to Cresphontes.</p>
			<p>Messenia was at this time ruled by Melanthus, a descendant of Neleus. This ancestor, a prince of the great house of æolus, had come from Thessaly and succeeded to the Messenian throne on the failure of the previous dynasty. Melanthus and his race were thus foreigners in Messenia and were unpopular. His subjects offered little or no opposition to the invading Dorians; Melanthus abandoned his kingdom to Cresphontes, and retired to Athens.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350" name="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>
			<p>Cresphontes married Merope, whose native country, Arcadia, was not affected by the Dorian invasion. This marriage, the issue of which was three sons, connected him with the native population of Peloponnesus. He built a new capital of Messenia, Stenyclaros, and transferred thither, from Pylos, the seat of government; he proposed, moreover, says Pausanias, to divide Messenia into five states, and to confer on the native Messenians equal privileges with their Dorian conquerors. The Dorians complained that his administration unduly favoured the vanquished people; his chief magnates, headed by Polyphontes, himself a descendant of Hercules, formed a cabal against him, and he was slain with his two eldest sons. The youngest son of Cresphontes, æpytus, then an infant, was saved by his mother, who sent him to her father, Cypselus, the king of Arcadia, under whose protection he was brought up.</p>
			<p>The drama begins at the moment when æpytus, grown to manhood, returns secretly to Messenia to take vengeance on his father’s murderers. At this period Temenus was no longer reigning at Argos; he had been murdered by his sons, jealous of their brother-in-law, Deiphontes. The sons of Aristodemus, Procles and Eurysthenes, at variance with their uncle and ex-guardian, Theras, were reigning at Sparta.</p>

				<span>Now crush’d but not quite lifeless by his fall.<br/></span>
				<span>And these men look to thee, and from thy grief⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Something too studiously, forgive me, shown⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Infer thee their accomplice; and they say<br/></span>
				<span>That thou in secret nurturest up thy son,<br/></span>
				<span>Him whom thou hiddest when thy husband fell,<br/></span>
				<span>To avenge that fall, and bring them back to power.<br/></span>
				<span>Such are their hopes⁠—I ask not if by thee<br/></span>
				<span>Willingly fed or no⁠—their most vain hopes;<br/></span>
				<span>For I have kept conspiracy fast-chain’d<br/></span>
				<span>Till now, and I have strength to chain it still.<br/></span>
				<span>But, Merope, the years advance;⁠—I stand<br/></span>
				<span>Upon the threshold of old age, alone,<br/></span>
				<span>Always in arms, always in face of foes.<br/></span>
				<span>The long repressive attitude of rule<br/></span>
				<span>Leaves me austerer, sterner, than I would;<br/></span>
				<span>Old age is more suspicious than the free<br/></span>
				<span>And valiant heart of youth, or manhood’s firm<br/></span>
				<span>Unclouded reason; I would not decline<br/></span>
				<span>Into a jealous tyrant, scourged with fears,<br/></span>
				<span>Closing in blood and gloom his sullen reign.<br/></span>
				<span>The cares which might in me with time, I feel,<br/></span>
				<span>Beget a cruel temper, help me quell!<br/></span>
				<span>The breach between our parties help me close!<br/></span>
				<span>Assist me to rule mildly; let us join<br/></span>
				<span>Our hands in solemn union, making friends<br/></span>
				<span>Our factions with the friendship of their chiefs.<br/></span>
				<span>Let us in marriage, King and Queen, unite<br/></span>
				<span>Claims ever hostile else, and set thy son⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>No more an exile fed on empty hopes,<br/></span>
				<span>And to an unsubstantial title heir,<br/></span>
				<span>But prince adopted by the will of power,<br/></span>
				<span>And future king⁠—before this people’s eyes.<br/></span>
				<span>Consider him! consider not old hates!<br/></span>
				<span>Consider, too, this people, who were dear<br/></span>
				<span>To their dead king, thy husband⁠—yea, too dear,<br/></span>
				<span>For that destroy’d him. Give them peace! thou can’st.<br/></span>
				<span>O Merope, how many noble thoughts,<br/></span>
				<span>How many precious feelings of man’s heart,<br/></span>
				<span>How many loves, how many gratitudes,<br/></span>

				<span>For private gain or hatred takes a life,<br/></span>
				<span>We call it murder, crush him, brand his name.<br/></span>
				<span>But when, for some great public cause, an arm<br/></span>

				<span>Against a power exempt from common checks,<br/></span>
				<span>Dangerous to all, to be but thus annull’d⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Ranks any man with murder such an act?<br/></span>
				<span>With grievous deeds, perhaps; with murder, no!<br/></span>
				<span>Find then such cause, the charge of murder falls⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Be judge thyself if it abound not here.<br/></span>

				<span>Soaring from his death-pile on œta, left<br/></span>
				<span>His puny, callow eaglets; and what trials⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Infirm protectors, dubious oracles<br/></span>
				<span>Construed awry, misplann’d invasions⁠—wore<br/></span>
				<span>Three generations of his offspring out;<br/></span>
				<span>Hardly the fourth, with grievous loss, regain’d<br/></span>
				<span>Their fathers’ realm, this isle, from Pelops named.<br/></span>
				<span>Who made that triumph, though deferr’d, secure?<br/></span>
				<span>Who, but the kinsmen of the royal brood<br/></span>
				<span>Of Heracles, scarce Heracleidæ less<br/></span>
				<span>Than they? these, and the Dorian lords, whose king<br/></span>
				<span>ægimius gave our outcast house a home<br/></span>
				<span>When Thebes, when Athens dared not; who in arms<br/></span>
				<span>Thrice issued with us from their pastoral vales,<br/></span>
				<span>And shed their blood like water in our cause?<br/></span>
				<span>Such were the dispossessors; of what stamp<br/></span>
				<span>Were they we dispossessed?⁠—of us I speak,<br/></span>
				<span>Who to Messenia with thy husband came;<br/></span>
				<span>I speak not now of Argos, where his brother,<br/></span>
				<span>Not now of Sparta, where his nephews reign’d.⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>What we found here were tribes of fame obscure,<br/></span>
				<span>Much turbulence, and little constancy,<br/></span>
				<span>Precariously ruled by foreign lords<br/></span>
				<span>From the æolian stock of Neleus sprung,<br/></span>
				<span>A house once great, now dwindling in its sons.<br/></span>
				<span>Such were the conquer’d, such the conquerors; who<br/></span>
				<span>Had most thy husband’s confidence? Consult<br/></span>
				<span>His acts! the wife he chose was⁠—full of virtues⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>But an Arcadian princess, more akin<br/></span>
				<span>To his new subjects than to us; his friends<br/></span>
				<span>Were the Messenian chiefs; the laws he framed<br/></span>
				<span>Were aim’d at their promotion, our decline.<br/></span>
				<span>And, finally, this land, then half-subdued,<br/></span>
				<span>Which from one central city’s guarded seat<br/></span>
				<span>As from a fastness in the rocks our scant<br/></span>
				<span>Handful of Dorian conquerors might have curb’d,<br/></span>
				<span>He parcell’d out in five confederate states,<br/></span>
				<span>Sowing his victors thinly through them all,<br/></span>
				<span>Mere prisoners, meant or not, among our foes.<br/></span>
				<span>If this was fear of them, it shamed the king;<br/></span>
				<span>If jealousy of us, it shamed the man.<br/></span>
				<span>Long we refrain’d ourselves, submitted long,<br/></span>
				<span>Construed his acts indulgently, revered,<br/></span>
				<span>Though found perverse, the blood of Heracles;<br/></span>
				<span>Reluctantly the rest⁠—but, against all,<br/></span>
				<span>One voice preach’d patience, and that voice was mine!<br/></span>
				<span>At last it reach’d us, that he, still mistrustful,<br/></span>

				<span>With compact in that concourse to deliver,<br/></span>
				<span>For death, his ancient to his new-made friends.<br/></span>
				<span>Patience was thenceforth self destruction. I,<br/></span>
				<span>I his chief kinsman, I his pioneer<br/></span>
				<span>And champion to the throne, I honouring most<br/></span>

				<span>Were hunted out, and to Achaia fled,<br/></span>

				<span>Who to the invading Dorians stretch’d a hand,<br/></span>

				<span>He would not let his savage chiefs alight,<br/></span>
				<span>A cloud of vultures, on this vigorous race,<br/></span>
				<span>Ravin a little while in spoil and blood,<br/></span>
				<span>Then, gorged and helpless, be assail’d and slain.<br/></span>
				<span>He would have saved you from your furious selves,<br/></span>
				<span>Not in abhorr’d estrangement let you stand;<br/></span>
				<span>He would have mix’d you with your friendly foes,<br/></span>
				<span>Foes dazzled with your prowess, well inclined<br/></span>
				<span>To reverence your lineage, more, to obey;<br/></span>
				<span>So would have built you, in a few short years,<br/></span>

				<span>O policy too subtle far for sense<br/></span>
				<span>Of heady, masterful, injurious men!<br/></span>
				<span>This good he meant you, and for this he died!<br/></span>
				<span>Yet not for this⁠—else might thy crime in part<br/></span>
				<span>Be error deem’d⁠—but that pretence is vain.<br/></span>
				<span>For, if ye slew him for supposed misrule,<br/></span>
				<span>Injustice to his kin and Dorian friends,<br/></span>
				<span>Why with the offending father did ye slay<br/></span>
				<span>Two unoffending babes, his innocent sons?<br/></span>

				<span>Forsworn their blood? ungratefully had <i>they</i><br/></span>
				<span>Preferr’d Messenian serfs to Dorian lords?<br/></span>
				<span>No! but to thy ambition their poor lives<br/></span>
				<span>Were bar⁠—and this, too, was their father’s crime.<br/></span>
				<span>That thou might’st reign he died, not for his fault<br/></span>
				<span>Even fancied; and his death thou wroughtest chief!<br/></span>
				<span>For, if the other lords desired his fall<br/></span>

				<span>Why dost thou only profit by his death?<br/></span>
				<span>Thy crown condemns thee, while thy tongue absolves.<br/></span>

				<span>Put tightness in thy gold-embossed rein,<br/></span>

				<span>Throw him a pealing word of summons down,<br/></span>
				<span>To come, a late avenger, to the aid<br/></span>

				<span>That will I do, and to this end I came.<br/></span>
				<span>For, being of like age, of birth not mean,<br/></span>
				<span>The son of an Arcadian noble, I<br/></span>
				<span>Was chosen his companion from a boy;<br/></span>
				<span>And on the hunting-rambles which his heart,<br/></span>
				<span>Unquiet, drove him ever to pursue<br/></span>
				<span>Through all the lordships of the Arcadian dales,<br/></span>
				<span>From chief to chief, I wander’d at his side,<br/></span>
				<span>The captain of his squires, and his guard.<br/></span>
				<span>On such a hunting-journey, three morns since,<br/></span>
				<span>With beaters, hounds, and huntsmen, he and I<br/></span>
				<span>Set forth from Tegea, the royal town.<br/></span>
				<span>The prince at start seem’d sad, but his regard<br/></span>
				<span>Clear’d with blithe travel and the morning air.<br/></span>
				<span>We rode from Tegea, through the woods of oaks,<br/></span>
				<span>Past Arnê spring, where Rhea gave the babe<br/></span>
				<span>Poseidon to the shepherd-boys to hide<br/></span>
				<span>From Saturn’s search among the new-yean’d lambs,<br/></span>
				<span>To Mantineia, with its unbaked walls;<br/></span>
				<span>Thence, by the Sea-God’s Sanctuary and the tomb<br/></span>
				<span>Whither from wintry Mænalus were brought<br/></span>
				<span>The bones of Arcas, whence our race is named,<br/></span>
				<span>On, to the marshy Orchomenian plain,<br/></span>
				<span>And the Stone Coffins;⁠—then, by Caphyæ Cliffs,<br/></span>
				<span>To Pheneos with its craggy citadel.<br/></span>
				<span>There, with the chief of that hill-town, we lodged<br/></span>
				<span>One night; and the next day at dawn fared on<br/></span>
				<span>By the Three Fountains and the Adder’s Hill<br/></span>
				<span>To the Stymphalian Lake, our journey’s end,<br/></span>
				<span>To draw the coverts on Cyllenê’s side.<br/></span>
				<span>There, on a high green spur which bathes its point<br/></span>
				<span>Far in the liquid lake, we sate, and drew<br/></span>
				<span>Cates from our hunters’ pouch, Arcadian fare,<br/></span>
				<span>Sweet chestnuts, barley-cakes, and boar’s-flesh dried;<br/></span>
				<span>And as we ate, and rested there, we talk’d<br/></span>
				<span>Of places we had pass’d, sport we had had,<br/></span>
				<span>Of beasts of chase that haunt the Arcadian hills,<br/></span>
				<span>Wild hog, and bear, and mountain-deer, and roe;<br/></span>
				<span>Last, of our quarters with the Arcadian chiefs.<br/></span>
				<span>For courteous entertainment, welcome warm,<br/></span>
				<span>Sad, reverential homage, had our prince<br/></span>
				<span>From all, for his great lineage and his woes;<br/></span>
				<span>All which he own’d, and praised with grateful mind.<br/></span>
				<span>But still over his speech a gloom there hung,<br/></span>
				<span>As of one shadow’d by impending death;<br/></span>
				<span>And strangely, as we talk’d, he would apply<br/></span>
				<span>The story of spots mention’d to his own;<br/></span>
				<span>Telling us, Arnê minded him, he too<br/></span>
				<span>Was saved a babe, but to a life obscure,<br/></span>
				<span>Which he, the seed of Heracles, dragg’d on<br/></span>
				<span>Inglorious, and should drop at last unknown,<br/></span>
				<span>Even as those dead unepitaph’d, who lie<br/></span>
				<span>In the stone coffins at Orchomenus.<br/></span>
				<span>And, then, he bade remember how we pass’d<br/></span>
				<span>The Mantineän Sanctuary, forbid<br/></span>
				<span>To foot of mortal, where his ancestor,<br/></span>
				<span>Named æpytus like him, having gone in,<br/></span>
				<span>Was blinded by the outgushing springs of brine.<br/></span>
				<span>Then, turning westward to the Adder’s Hill⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>
					<i>Another ancestor, named, too, like me,</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
				<span><i>Died of a snake-bite</i>, said he, <i>on that brow;</i><br/></span>
				<span>
					<i>Still at his mountain-tomb men marvel, built</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
				<span>
					<i>Where, as life ebb’d, his bearers laid him down.</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
				<span>So he play’d on; then ended, with a smile:<br/></span>
				<span>
					<i>This region is not happy for my race.</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
				<span>We cheer’d him; but, that moment, from the copse<br/></span>
				<span>By the lake-edge, broke the sharp cry of hounds;<br/></span>
				<span>The prickers shouted that the stag was gone.<br/></span>
				<span>We sprang upon our feet, we snatch’d our spears,<br/></span>
				<span>We bounded down the swarded slope, we plunged<br/></span>
				<span>Through the dense ilex-thickets to the dogs.<br/></span>
				<span>Far in the woods ahead their music rang;<br/></span>
				<span>And many times that morn we coursed in ring<br/></span>
				<span>The forests round that belt Cyllenê’s side;<br/></span>
				<span>Till I, thrown out and tired, came to halt<br/></span>
				<span>On that same spur where we had sate at morn.<br/></span>
				<span>And resting there to breathe, I watch’d the chase⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Rare, straggling hunters, foil’d by brake and crag,<br/></span>
				<span>And the prince, single, pressing on the rear<br/></span>
				<span>Of that unflagging quarry and the hounds.<br/></span>
				<span>Now in the woods far down I saw them cross<br/></span>
				<span>An open glade; now he was high aloft<br/></span>
				<span>On some tall scar fringed with dark feathery pines,<br/></span>
				<span>Peering to spy a goat-track down the cliff,<br/></span>
				<span>Cheering with hand, and voice, and horn his dogs.<br/></span>
				<span>At last the cry drew to the water’s edge⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>And through the brushwood, to the pebbly strand,<br/></span>
				<span>Broke, black with sweat, the antler’d mountain-stag,<br/></span>
				<span>And took the lake. Two hounds alone pursued,<br/></span>
				<span>Then came the prince; he shouted and plunged in.<br/></span>
				<span>—There is a chasm rifted in the base<br/></span>
				<span>Of that unfooted precipice, whose rock<br/></span>
				<span>Walls on one side the deep Stymphalian Lake;<br/></span>
				<span>There the lake-waters, which in ages gone<br/></span>
				<span>Wash’d, as the marks upon the hills still show,<br/></span>
				<span>All the Stymphalian plain, are now suck’d down.<br/></span>
				<span>A headland, with one aged plane-tree crown’d,<br/></span>
				<span>Parts from this cave-pierced cliff the shelving bay<br/></span>
				<span>Where first the chase plunged in; the bay is smooth,<br/></span>
				<span>But round the headland’s point a current sets,<br/></span>
				<span>Strong, black, tempestuous, to the cavern-mouth.<br/></span>
				<span>Stoutly, under the headland’s lee, they swam;<br/></span>
				<span>But when they came abreast the point, the race<br/></span>
				<span>Caught them as wind takes feathers, whirl’d them round<br/></span>
				<span>Struggling in vain to cross it, swept them on,<br/></span>
				<span>Stag, dogs, and hunter, to the yawning gulph.<br/></span>
				<span>All this, O King, not piecemeal, as to thee<br/></span>
				<span>Now told, but in one flashing instant pass’d.<br/></span>
				<span>While from the turf whereon I lay I sprang<br/></span>
				<span>And took three strides, quarry and dogs were gone;<br/></span>
				<span>A moment more⁠—I saw the prince turn round<br/></span>
				<span>Once in the black and arrowy race, and cast<br/></span>
				<span>An arm aloft for help; then sweep beneath<br/></span>
				<span>The low-brow’d cavern-arch, and disappear.<br/></span>
				<span>And what I could, I did⁠—to call by cries<br/></span>
				<span>Some straggling hunters to my aid, to rouse<br/></span>
				<span>Fishers who live on the lake-side, to launch<br/></span>
				<span>Boats, and approach, near as we dared, the chasm.<br/></span>
				<span>But of the prince nothing remain’d, save this,<br/></span>
				<span>His boar-spear’s broken shaft, back on the lake<br/></span>
				<span>Cast by the rumbling subterranean stream;<br/></span>
				<span>And this, at landing spied by us and saved,<br/></span>
				<span>His broad-brimm’d hunter’s hat, which, in the bay,<br/></span>
				<span>Where first the stag took water, floated still.<br/></span>
				<span>And I across the mountains brought with haste<br/></span>
				<span>To Cypselus, at Basilis, this news⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Basilis, his new city, which he now<br/></span>
				<span>Near Lycosura builds, Lycaon’s town,<br/></span>
				<span>First city founded on the earth by men.<br/></span>
				<span>He to thee sends me on, in one thing glad,<br/></span>
				<span>While all else grieves him, that his grandchild’s death<br/></span>
				<span>Extinguishes distrust ’twixt him and thee.<br/></span>
				<span>But I from our deplored mischance learn this:<br/></span>
				<span>The man who to untimely death is doom’d,<br/></span>
				<span>Vainly you hedge him from the assault of harm;<br/></span>

				<span>Lifted, and that unwish’d-for heirship void⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>A tale, meanwhile, forged for his subjects’ ears⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>And me, henceforth sole rival with himself<br/></span>
				<span>In their allegiance, me, in my son’s death-hour,<br/></span>
				<span>When all turn’d tow’rds me, me he would have shown<br/></span>

				<span>The willing sharer of his guilty rule,<br/></span>
				<span>All claim to succour forfeit, to myself<br/></span>

				<span>His offers I repell’d⁠—but what of that?<br/></span>
				<span>If with no rage, no fire of righteous hate,<br/></span>
				<span>Such as ere now hath spurr’d to fearful deeds<br/></span>
				<span>Weak women with a thousandth part my wrongs,<br/></span>
				<span>But calm, but unresentful, I endured<br/></span>
				<span>His offers, coldly heard them, cold repell’d?<br/></span>
				<span>How must men think me abject, void of heart,<br/></span>
				<span>While all this time I bear to linger on<br/></span>
				<span>In this blood-deluged palace, in whose halls<br/></span>
				<span>Either a vengeful Fury I should stalk,<br/></span>
				<span>Or else not live at all!⁠—but here I haunt,<br/></span>
				<span>A pale, unmeaning ghost, powerless to fright<br/></span>
				<span>Or harm, and nurse my longing for my son,<br/></span>
				<span>A helpless one, I know it⁠—but the Gods<br/></span>
				<span>Have temper’d me e’en thus, and, in some souls,<br/></span>
				<span>Misery, which rouses others, breaks the spring.<br/></span>
				<span>And even now, my son, ah me! my son,<br/></span>
				<span>Fain would I fade away, as I have lived,<br/></span>
				<span>Without a cry, a struggle, or a blow,<br/></span>
				<span>All vengeance unattempted, and descend<br/></span>
				<span>To the invisible plains, to roam with thee,<br/></span>
				<span>Fit denizen, the lampless under-world⁠—⁠<br/></span>
				<span>But with what eyes should I encounter there<br/></span>
				<span>My husband, wandering with his stern compeers,<br/></span>
				<span>Amphiaraos, or Mycenæ’s king,<br/></span>
				<span>Who led the Greeks to Ilium, Agamemnon,<br/></span>
				<span>Betray’d like him, but, not like him, avenged?<br/></span>
				<span>Or with what voice shall I the questions meet<br/></span>
				<span>Of my two elder sons, slain long ago,<br/></span>
				<span>Who sadly ask me, what, if not revenge,<br/></span>
				<span>Kept me, their mother, from their side so long?<br/></span>

				<span>Mere ruthless and uncounsell’d wolves of war,<br/></span>
				<span>Good to obey, without a leader nought.<br/></span>
				<span>Their chief hath train’d them, made them like himself,<br/></span>

				<span>Against surprise and sudden panic proof.<br/></span>
				<span>Their master fall’n, these will not flinch, but band<br/></span>

				<span>Discrediting the succour which our cause<br/></span>
				<span>Might from the people draw, if rightly used;<br/></span>
				<span>Advising us a course which would, indeed,<br/></span>
				<span>If follow’d, make their succour slack and null.<br/></span>
				<span>A people is no army, train’d to fight,<br/></span>
				<span>A passive engine, at their general’s will;<br/></span>
				<span>And, if so used, proves, as thou say’st, unsure.<br/></span>
				<span>A people, like a common man, is dull,<br/></span>
				<span>Is lifeless, while its heart remains untouch’d;<br/></span>
				<span>A fool can drive it, and a fly may scare.<br/></span>
				<span>When it admires and loves, its heart awakes:<br/></span>
				<span>Then irresistibly it lives, it works;<br/></span>
				<span>A people, then, is an ally indeed⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>It is ten thousand fiery wills in one.<br/></span>
				<span>Now I, if I invite them to run risk<br/></span>
				<span>Of life for my advantage, and myself,<br/></span>
				<span>Who chiefly profit, run no more than they⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>How shall I rouse their love, their ardour so?<br/></span>
				<span>But, if some signal, unassisted stroke,<br/></span>
				<span>Dealt at my own sole risk, before their eyes,<br/></span>
				<span>Announces me their rightful prince return’d⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>The undegenerate blood of Heracles⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>The daring claimant of a perilous throne⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>How might not such a sight as this revive<br/></span>
				<span>Their loyal passion tow’rd my father’s house,<br/></span>
				<span>Kindle their hearts, make them no more a mob,<br/></span>
				<span>A craven mob, but a devouring fire?<br/></span>
				<span>Then might I use them, then, for one who thus<br/></span>
				<span>Spares not himself, themselves they will not spare.<br/></span>
				<span>Haply, had but one daring soul stood forth<br/></span>
				<span>To rally them and lead them to revenge,<br/></span>
				<span>When my great father fell, they had replied!<br/></span>
				<span>Alas! our foe alone stood forward then.<br/></span>
				<span>And thou, my mother, hadst thou made a sign⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Hadst thou, from thy forlorn and captive state<br/></span>
				<span>Of widowhood in these polluted halls,<br/></span>
				<span>Thy prison-house, raised one imploring cry⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>Who knows but that avengers thou hadst found?<br/></span>
				<span>But mute thou sat’st, and each Messenian heart<br/></span>
				<span>In thy despondency desponded too.<br/></span>
				<span>Enough of this!⁠—Though not a finger stir<br/></span>
				<span>To succour me in my extremest need;<br/></span>
				<span>Though all free spirits in this land were dead,<br/></span>
				<span>And only slaves and tyrants left alive;<br/></span>
				<span>Yet for me, mother, I had liefer die<br/></span>
				<span>On native ground, than drag the tedious hours<br/></span>
				<span>Of a protected exile any more.<br/></span>
				<span>Hate, duty, interest, passion call one way;<br/></span>

				<span>At thy dead husband’s name the people show.<br/></span>
				<span>For when this morning in the public square<br/></span>
				<span>I took my stand, and saw the unarm’d crowds<br/></span>
				<span>Of citizens in holiday attire,<br/></span>
				<span>Women and children intermix’d; and then,<br/></span>
				<span>Group’d around Zeus’s altar, all in arms,<br/></span>
				<span>Serried and grim, the ring of Dorian lords⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>I trembled for our prince and his attempt.<br/></span>
				<span>Silence and expectation held us all;<br/></span>
				<span>Till presently the King came forth, in robe<br/></span>
				<span>Of sacrifice, his guards clearing the way<br/></span>
				<span>Before him⁠—at his side, the prince, thy son,<br/></span>
				<span>Unarm’d and travel-soil’d, just as he was.<br/></span>
				<span>With him conferring the King slowly reach’d<br/></span>
				<span>The altar in the middle of the square,<br/></span>
				<span>Where, by the sacrificing minister,<br/></span>
				<span>The flower-dress’d victim stood⁠—a milk-white bull,<br/></span>
				<span>Swaying from side to side his massy head<br/></span>
				<span>With short impatient lowings. There he stopp’d,<br/></span>
				<span>And seem’d to muse awhile, then raised his eyes<br/></span>
				<span>To heaven, and laid his hand upon the steer,<br/></span>
				<span>And cried: <i>O Zeus, let what blood-guiltiness</i><br/></span>
				<span>
					<i>Yet stains our land be by this blood wash’d out,</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
				<span>
					<i>And grant henceforth to the Messenians peace!</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
				<span>That moment, while with upturn’d eyes he pray’d,<br/></span>
				<span>The prince snatch’d from the sacrificer’s hand<br/></span>
				<span>The axe, and on the forehead of the King,<br/></span>
				<span>Where twines the chaplet, dealt a mighty blow<br/></span>
				<span>Which fell’d him to the earth, and o’er him stood,<br/></span>
				<span>And shouted: <i>Since by thee defilement came,</i><br/></span>
				<span>
					<i>What blood so meet as thine to wash it out?</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
				<span>
					<i>What hand to strike thee meet as mine, the hand</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
				<span><i>Of æpytus, thy murder’d master’s son?</i>⁠—<br/></span>
				<span>But, gazing at him from the ground, the King.⁠ ⁠…<br/></span>
				<span><i>Is it, then, thou?</i> he murmur’d; and with that,<br/></span>
				<span>He bow’d his head, and deeply groan’d, and died.<br/></span>
				<span>Till then we all seem’d stone, but then a cry<br/></span>
				<span>Broke from the Dorian lords; forward they rush’d<br/></span>
				<span>To circle the prince round⁠—when suddenly<br/></span>
				<span>Laias in arms sprang to his nephew’s side,<br/></span>
				<span>Crying: <i>O ye Messenians, will ye leave</i><br/></span>
				<span>
					<i>The son to perish as ye left the sire?</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
				<span>And from that moment I saw nothing clear;<br/></span>
				<span>For from all sides a deluge, as it seem’d<br/></span>
				<span>Burst o’er the altar and the Dorian lords,<br/></span>
				<span>Of holiday-clad citizens transform’d<br/></span>
				<span>To armed warriors;⁠—I heard vengeful cries,<br/></span>
				<span>I heard the clash of weapons; then I saw<br/></span>
				<span>The Dorians lying dead, thy son hail’d king.<br/></span>
				<span>And, truly, one who sees, what seem’d so strong,<br/></span>
				<span>The power of this tyrant and his lords,<br/></span>
				<span>Melt like a passing smoke, a nightly dream,<br/></span>
				<span>At one bold word, one enterprising blow⁠—<br/></span>

				<span>But yet, not knowing this, I triumph not<br/></span>
				<span>Over thy corpse⁠—triumph not, neither mourn⁠—<br/></span>

				<span>O strong soul, by what shore</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tarriest thou now? For that force,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Surely, has not been left vain!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Somewhere, surely, afar,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the sounding labour-house vast</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of being, is practised that strength,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Zealous, beneficent, firm!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, in some far-shining sphere,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Conscious or not of the past,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still thou performest the word</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the Spirit in whom thou dost live⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Prompt, unwearied, as here!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still thou upraisest with zeal</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The humble good from the ground,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sternly repressest the bad!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still, like a trumpet, dost rouse</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Those who with half-open eyes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tread the border-land dim</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Twixt vice and virtue; reviv’st,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Succourest!⁠—this was thy work,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This was thy life upon earth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What is the course of the life</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of mortal men on the earth?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Most men eddy about</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here and there⁠—eat and drink,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Chatter and love and hate,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gather and squander, are raised</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Aloft, are hurl’d in the dust,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Striving blindly, achieving</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nothing; and then they die⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Perish;⁠—and no one asks</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who or what they have been,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>More than he asks what waves,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the moonlit solitudes mild</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the midmost Ocean, have swell’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Foam’d for a moment, and gone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And there are some, whom a thirst</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ardent, unquenchable, fires,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not with the crowd to be spent,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not without aim to go round</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In an eddy of purposeless dust,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Effort unmeaning and vain.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah yes! some of us strive</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not without action to die</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fruitless, but something to snatch</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From dull oblivion, nor all</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Glut the devouring grave!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We, we have chosen our path⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Path to a clear-purposed goal,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Path of advance!⁠—but it leads</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A long, steep journey, through sunk</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gorges, o’er mountains in snow.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cheerful, with friends, we set forth⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then, on the height, comes the storm.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thunder crashes from rock</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To rock, the cataracts reply,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lightnings dazzle our eyes.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Roaring torrents have breach’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The track, the stream-bed descends</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the place where the wayfarer once</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Planted his footstep⁠—the spray</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Boils o’er its borders! aloft</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The unseen snow-beds dislodge</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their hanging ruin; alas,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Havoc is made in our train!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Friends, who set forth at our side,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Falter, are lost in the storm.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We, we only are left!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With frowning foreheads, with lips</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sternly compress’d, we strain on,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On⁠—and at nightfall at last</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come to the end of our way,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To the lonely inn ‘mid the rocks;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where the gaunt and taciturn host</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stands on the threshold, the wind</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shaking his thin white hairs⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Holds his lantern to scan</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our storm-beat figures, and asks:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whom in our party we bring?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whom we have left in the snow?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sadly we answer: We bring</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Only ourselves! we lost</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sight of the rest in the storm.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hardly ourselves we fought through,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stripp’d, without friends, as we are.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Friends, companions, and train,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The avalanche swept from our side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But thou would’st not <i>alone</i></span>
						<br/>
				<span>Be saved, my father! <i>alone</i></span>
						<br/>
				<span>Conquer and come to thy goal,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Leaving the rest in the wild.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We were weary, and we</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fearful, and we in our march</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fain to drop down and to die.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still thou turnedst, and still</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beckonedst the trembler, and still</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gavest the weary thy hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If, in the paths of the world,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stones might have wounded thy feet,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Toil or dejection have tried</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thy spirit, of that we saw</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nothing⁠—to us thou wast still</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cheerful, and helpful, and firm!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Therefore to thee it was given</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Many to save with thyself;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, at the end of thy day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O faithful shepherd! to come,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bringing thy sheep in thy hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And through thee I believe</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the noble and great who are gone;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pure souls honour’d and blest</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By former ages, who else⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Such, so soulless, so poor,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is the race of men whom I see⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Seem’d but a dream of the heart,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Seem’d but a cry of desire.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yes! I believe that there lived</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Others like thee in the past,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not like the men of the crowd</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who all round me to-day</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bluster or cringe, and make life</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hideous, and arid, and vile;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But souls temper’d with fire,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fervent, heroic, and good,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Helpers and friends of mankind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Servants of God!⁠—or sons</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shall I not call you? because</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not as servants ye knew</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Your Father’s innermost mind,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His, who unwillingly sees</span>
						<br/>
				<span>One of his little ones lost⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yours is the praise, if mankind</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath not as yet in its march</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fainted, and fallen, and died!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>See! In the rocks of the world</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Marches the host of mankind,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A feeble, wavering line.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where are they tending?⁠—A God</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Marshall’d them, gave them their goal.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah, but the way is so long!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Years they have been in the wild!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sore thirst plagues them, the rocks,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rising all round, overawe;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Factions divide them, their host</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Threatens to break, to dissolve.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Ah, keep, keep them combined!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Else, of the myriads who fill</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That army, not one shall arrive;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sole they shall stray; in the rocks</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stagger for ever in vain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Die one by one in the waste.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, in such hour of need</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of your fainting, dispirited race,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ye, like angels, appear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Radiant with ardour divine!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beacons of hope, ye appear!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Languor is not in your heart,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Weakness is not in your word,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Weariness not on your brow.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ye alight in our van! at your voice,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Panic, despair, flee away.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ye move through the ranks, recall</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The stragglers, refresh the outworn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Praise, re-inspire the brave!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Order, courage, return.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Eyes rekindling, and prayers,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Follow your steps as ye go.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ye fill up the gaps in our files,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Strengthen the wavering line,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stablish, continue our march,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On, to the bound of the waste,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On, to the City of God.</span>

				<span>Far on its rocky knoll descried</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Saint Michael’s chapel cuts the sky.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I climb’d;⁠—beneath me, bright and wide,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lay the lone coast of Brittany.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bright in the sunset, weird and still,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It lay beside the Atlantic wave,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As though the wizard Merlin’s will</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet charm’d it from his forest-grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Behind me on their grassy sweep,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bearded with lichen, scrawl’d and grey,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The giant stones of Carnac sleep,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the mild evening of the May.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No priestly stern procession now</span>

				<span>Moves through their rows of pillars old;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No victims bleed, no Druids bow⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sheep make the daisied aisles their fold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From bush to bush the cuckoo flies,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The orchis red gleams everywhere;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gold furze with broom in blossom vies,</span>

				<span>The blue-bells perfume all the air.</span>

			<p>
				<span>And o’er the glistening, lonely land,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rise up, all round, the Christian spires;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The church of Carnac, by the strand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Catches the westering sun’s last fires.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And there, across the watery way,</span>

						<br/>
				<span>The sickle-sweep of Quiberon Bay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose beach once ran with loyal blood!</span>

			<p>
				<span>And beyond that, the Atlantic wide!⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All round, no soul, no boat, no hail;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, on the horizon’s verge descried,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hangs, touch’d with light, one snowy sail!</span>

				<span>Some youthful troubadour, whose tongue</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fill’d Europe once with his love-pain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who here outworn had sunk, and sung</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His dying strain;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some girl, who here from castle-bower,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With furtive step and cheek of flame,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Twixt myrtle-hedges all in flower</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By moonlight came</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To meet her pirate-lover’s ship;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And from the wave-kiss’d marble stair</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beckon’d him on, with quivering lip</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And floating hair;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And lived some moons in happy trance,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then learnt his death and pined away⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Such by these waters of romance</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Twas meet to lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But you⁠—a grave for knight or sage,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Romantic, solitary, still,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O spent ones of a work-day age!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Befits you ill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So sang I; but the midnight breeze,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down to the brimm’d, moon-charmed main,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Comes softly through the olive-trees,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And checks my strain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I think of her, whose gentle tongue</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All plaint in her own cause controll’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of thee I think, my brother! young</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In heart, high-soul’d⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That comely face, that cluster’d brow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That cordial hand, that bearing free,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I see them still, I see them now,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shall always see!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And what but gentleness untired,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And what but noble feeling warm,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wherever shown, howe’er inspired,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is grace, is charm?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What else is all these waters are,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What else is steep’d in lucid sheen,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What else is bright, what else is fair,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What else serene?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mild o’er her grave, ye mountains, shine!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gently by his, ye waters, glide!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To that in you which is divine</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They were allied.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Saint Brandan sails the northern main;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The brotherhoods of saints are glad.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He greets them once, he sails again;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So late!⁠—such storms!⁠—The Saint is mad!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He heard, across the howling seas,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Chime convent-bells on wintry nights;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He saw, on spray-swept Hebrides,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Twinkle the monastery-lights.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But north, still north, Saint Brandan steer’d⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And now no bells, no convents more!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The hurtling Polar lights are near’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The sea without a human shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At last⁠—(it was the Christmas night;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stars shone after a day of storm)⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He sees float past an iceberg white,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And on it⁠—Christ!⁠—a living form.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That furtive mien, that scowling eye,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of hair that red and tufted fell⁠—⁠</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It is⁠—Oh, where shall Brandan fly?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The traitor Judas, out of hell!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Palsied with terror, Brandan sate;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The moon was bright, the iceberg near.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He hears a voice sigh humbly: “Wait!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By high permission I am here.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“One moment wait, thou holy man!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On earth my crime, my death, they knew;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My name is under all men’s ban⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah, tell them of my respite too!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Tell them, one blessed Christmas-night⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>(It was the first after I came,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Breathing self-murder, frenzy, spite,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To rue my guilt in endless flame)⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I felt, as I in torment lay</span>
						<br/>
				<span>‘Mid the souls plagued by heavenly power,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>An angel touch mine arm, and say:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Go hence and cool thyself an hour!</i>
					
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Ah, whence this mercy, Lord?’ I said.</span>
						<br/>
				<span><i>The Leper recollect</i>, said he,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Who ask’d the passers-by for aid,</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>In Joppa, and thy charity.</i>
					
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then I remember’d how I went,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In Joppa, through the public street,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>One morn when the sirocco spent</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its storms of dust with burning heat;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And in the street a leper sate,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shivering with fever, naked, old;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sand raked his sores from heel to pate,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The hot wind fever’d him five-fold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He gazed upon me as I pass’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And murmur’d: <i>Help me, or I die!</i>⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To the poor wretch my cloak I cast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Saw him look eased, and hurried by.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh, Brandan, think what grace divine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What blessing must full goodness shower,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When fragment of it small, like mine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath such inestimable power!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Well-fed, well-clothed, well-friended, I</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Did that chance act of good, that one!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then went my way to kill and lie⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Forgot my good as soon as done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That germ of kindness, in the womb</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of mercy caught, did not expire;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Outlives my guilt, outlives my doom,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And friends me in the pit of fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Once every year, when carols wake,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On earth, the Christmas-night’s repose,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Arising from the sinners’ lake,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I journey to these healing snows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I stanch with ice my burning breast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With silence balm my whirling brain.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O Brandan! to this hour of rest</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That Joppan leper’s ease was pain.”⁠⸺⁠</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Tears started to Saint Brandan’s eyes;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He bow’d his head, he breathed a prayer⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then look’d, and lo, the frosty skies!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The iceberg, and no Judas there!</span>

				<span>“<i>Henri Heine</i>“⁠⸺ ’tis here!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That black tombstone, the name</span>

				<span>Carved there⁠—no more! and the smooth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Swarded alleys, the limes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Touch’d with yellow by hot</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Summer, but under them still,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In September’s bright afternoon,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shadow, and verdure, and cool.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Trim Montmartre! the faint</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Murmur of Paris outside;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crisp everlasting-flowers,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yellow and black, on the graves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Half blind, palsied, in pain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hither to come, from the streets’</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Uproar, surely not loath</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wast thou, Heine!⁠—to lie</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Quiet, to ask for closed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shutters, and darken’d room,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And cool drinks, and an eased</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Posture, and opium, no more;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hither to come, and to sleep</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Under the wings of Renown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! not little, when pain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is most quelling, and man</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Easily quell’d, and the fine</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Temper of genius so soon</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thrills at each smart, is the praise,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not to have yielded to pain!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No small boast, for a weak</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Son of mankind, to the earth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pinn’d by the thunder, to rear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His bolt-scathed front to the stars;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, undaunted, retort</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Gainst thick-crashing, insane,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tyrannous tempests of bale,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Arrowy lightnings of soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hark! through the alley resounds</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mocking laughter! A film</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Creeps o’er the sunshine; a breeze</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ruffles the warm afternoon,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Saddens my soul with its chill.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gibing of spirits in scorn</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shakes every leaf of the grove,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mars the benignant repose</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of this amiable home of the dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bitter spirits, ye claim</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heine?⁠—Alas, he is yours!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Only a moment I long’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here in the quiet to snatch</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From such mates the outworn</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Poet, and steep him in calm.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Only a moment! I knew</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose he was who is here</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Buried⁠—I knew he was yours!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah, I knew that I saw</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here no sepulchre built</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the laurell’d rock, o’er the blue</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Naples bay, for a sweet</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tender Virgil! no tomb</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On Ravenna sands, in the shade</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Ravenna pines, for a high</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Austere Dante! no grave</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By the Avon side, in the bright</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stratford meadows, for thee,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shakespeare! loveliest of souls,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Peerless in radiance, in joy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What, then, so harsh and malign,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heine! distils from thy life?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Poisons the peace of the grave?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I chide with thee not, that thy sharp</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Upbraidings often assail’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>England, my country⁠—for we,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heavy and sad, for her sons,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Long since, deep in our hearts,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Echo the blame of her foes.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We, too, sigh that she flags;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We, too, say that she now⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Scarce comprehending the voice</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of her greatest, golden-mouth’d sons</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of a former age any more⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stupidly travels her round</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of mechanic business, and lets</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Slow die out of her life</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Glory, and genius, and joy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So thou arraign’st her, her foe;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So we arraign her, her sons.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, we arraign her! but she,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The weary Titan, with deaf</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ears, and labour-dimm’d eyes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Regarding neither to right</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor left, goes passively by,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Staggering on to her goal;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bearing on shoulders immense,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Atlanteän, the load,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wellnigh not to be borne,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the too vast orb of her fate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But was it thou⁠—I think</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Surely it was!⁠—that bard</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Unnamed, who, Goethe said,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Had every other gift, but wanted love;</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Love, without which the tongue</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Even of angels sounds amiss?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Charm is the glory which makes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Song of the poet divine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Love is the fountain of charm.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How without charm wilt thou draw,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Poet! the world to thy way?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not by the lightnings of wit⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not by the thunder of scorn!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>These to the world, too, are given;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wit it possesses, and scorn⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Charm is the poet’s alone.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Hollow and dull are the great,</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>And artists envious, and the mob profane.</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We know all this, we know!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cam’st thou from heaven, O child</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of light! but this to declare?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Alas, to help us forget</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Such barren knowledge awhile,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>God gave the poet his song!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Therefore a secret unrest</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tortured thee, brilliant and bold!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Therefore triumph itself</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tasted amiss to thy soul.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Therefore, with blood of thy foes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Trickled in silence thine own.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Therefore the victor’s heart</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Broke on the field of his fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! as of old, from the pomp</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Italian Milan, the fair</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Flower of marble of white</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Southern palaces⁠—steps</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Border’d by statues, and walks</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Terraced, and orange-bowers</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heavy with fragrance⁠—the blond</span>
						<br/>
				<span>German Kaiser full oft</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Long’d himself back to the fields,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rivers, and high-roof’d towns</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of his native Germany; so,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So, how often! from hot</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Paris drawing-rooms, and lamps</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Blazing, and brilliant crowds,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Starr’d and jewell’d, of men</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Famous, of women the queens</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of dazzling converse⁠—from fumes</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of praise, hot, heady fumes, to the poor brain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That mount, that madden⁠—how oft</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heine’s spirit outworn</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Long’d itself out of the din,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Back to the tranquil, the cool</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Far German home of his youth!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>See! in the May-afternoon,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O’er the fresh, short turf of the Hartz,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A youth, with the foot of youth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heine! thou climbest again!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Up, through the tall dark firs</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Warming their heads in the sun,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Chequering the grass with their shade⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Up, by the stream, with its huge</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Moss-hung boulders, and thin</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Musical water half-hid⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Up, o’er the rock-strewn slope,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With the sinking sun, and the air</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Chill, and the shadows now</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Long on the grey hill-side⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To the stone-roof’d hut at the top!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or, yet later, in watch</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the roof of the Brocken-tower</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou standest, gazing!⁠—to see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The broad red sun, over field,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Forest, and city, and spire,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And mist-track’d stream of the wide,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wide German land, going down</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In a bank of vapours⁠—⁠again</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Standest, at nightfall, alone!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or, next morning, with limbs</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rested by slumber, and heart</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Freshen’d and light with the May,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O’er the gracious spurs coming down</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the Lower Hartz, among oaks,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And beechen coverts, and copse</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of hazels green in whose depth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ilse, the fairy transform’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In a thousand water-breaks light</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pours her petulant youth⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Climbing the rock which juts</span>
						<br/>
				<span>O’er the valley, the dizzily perch’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rock⁠—to its iron cross</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Once more thou cling’st; to the Cross</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Clingest! with smiles, with a sigh!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Goethe, too, had been there.<a id="FNanchor_24_26" name="FNanchor_24_26"/><a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_24_26">[24]</a></span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the long-past winter he came</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To the frozen Hartz, with his soul</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Passionate, eager⁠—his youth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All in ferment!⁠—but he</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Destined to work and to live</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Left it, and thou, alas!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Only to laugh and to die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But something prompts me: Not thus</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Take leave of Heine! not thus</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Speak the last word at his grave!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not in pity, and not</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With half censure⁠—with awe</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hail, as it passes from earth</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Scattering lightnings, that soul!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Spirit of the world,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beholding the absurdity of men⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their vaunts, their feats⁠—let a sardonic smile,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For one short moment, wander o’er his lips.</span>
						<br/>
				<span><i>That smile was Heine!</i>⁠—for its earthly hour</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The strange guest sparkled; now ’tis pass’d away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That was Heine! and we,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Myriads who live, who have lived,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What are we all, but a mood,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A single mood, of the life</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the Spirit in whom we exist,</span>

				<span>What made my heart, at Newstead, fullest swell?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Twas not the thought of Byron, of his cry</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stormily sweet, his Titan-agony;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It was the sight of that Lord Arundel</span>

				<span>Who struck, in heat, his child he loved so well,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And his child’s reason flicker’d, and did die.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Painted (he will’d it) in the gallery</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They hang; the picture doth the story tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Behold the stern, mail’d father, staff in hand!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The little fair-hair’d son, with vacant gaze,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where no more lights of sense or knowledge are!</span>

			<p>
				<span>Methinks the woe, which made that father stand</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Baring his dumb remorse to future days,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Was woe than Byron’s woe more tragic far.</span>

				<span>Once pass’d I blindfold here, at any hour;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Now seldom come I, since I came with him.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That single elm-tree bright</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Against the west⁠—I miss it! is it gone?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We prized it dearly; while it stood, we said,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our friend, the Gipsy-Scholar, was not dead;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>While the tree lived, he in these fields lived on.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But once I knew each field, each flower, each stick;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And with the country-folk acquaintance made</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By barn in threshing-time, by new-built rick.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here, too, our shepherd-pipes we first assay’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah me! this many a year</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My pipe is lost, my shepherd’s holiday!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Needs must I lose them, needs with heavy heart</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Into the world and wave of men depart;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Thyrsis of his own will went away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It irk’d him to be here, he could not rest.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He loved each simple joy the country yields,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He loved his mates; but yet he could not keep,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For that a shadow lour’d on the fields,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here with the shepherds and the silly sheep.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some life of men unblest</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He knew, which made him droop, and fill’d his head.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He went; his piping took a troubled sound</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of storms that rage outside our happy ground;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He could not wait their passing, he is dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, some tempestuous morn in early June,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When the year’s primal burst of bloom is o’er,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Before the roses and the longest day⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When garden-walks and all the grassy floor</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With blossoms red and white of fallen May</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And chestnut-flowers are strewn⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So have I heard the cuckoo’s parting cry,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From the wet field, through the vext garden-trees,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come with the volleying rain and tossing breeze:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>The bloom is gone, and with the bloom go I!</i>
					
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Too quick despairer, wherefore wilt thou go?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Soon will the high Midsummer pomps come on,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Soon will the musk carnations break and swell,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Soon shall we have gold-dusted snapdragon,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sweet-William with his homely cottage-smell,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And stocks in fragrant blow;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Roses that down the alleys shine afar,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And open, jasmine-muffled lattices,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And groups under the dreaming garden-trees,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the full moon, and the white evening-star.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He hearkens not! light comer, he is flown!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What matters it? next year he will return,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And we shall have him in the sweet spring-days,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With whitening hedges, and uncrumpling fern,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And blue-bells trembling by the forest-ways,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And scent of hay new-mown.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Thyrsis never more we swains shall see;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>See him come back, and cut a smoother reed,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And blow a strain the world at last shall heed⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For Time, not Corydon, hath conquer’d thee!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alack, for Corydon no rival now!⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But when Sicilian shepherds lost a mate,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some good survivor with his flute would go,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Piping a ditty sad for Bion’s fate;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And cross the unpermitted ferry’s flow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And relax Pluto’s brow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And make leap up with joy the beauteous head</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Proserpine, among whose crowned hair</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Are flowers first open’d on Sicilian air,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And flute his friend, like Orpheus, from the dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O easy access to the hearer’s grace</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When Dorian shepherds sang to Proserpine!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For she herself had trod Sicilian fields,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She knew the Dorian water’s gush divine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She knew each lily white which Enna yields,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Each rose with blushing face;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She loved the Dorian pipe, the Dorian strain.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But ah, of our poor Thames she never heard!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Her foot the Cumner cowslips never stirr’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And we should tease her with our plaint in vain!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well! wind-dispersed and vain the words will be,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet, Thyrsis, let me give my grief its hour</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the old haunt, and find our tree-topp’d hill!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who, if not I, for questing here hath power?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I know the wood which hides the daffodil,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I know the Fyfield tree,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I know what white, what purple fritillaries</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The grassy harvest of the river-fields,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Above by Ensham, down by Sandford, yields,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And what sedged brooks are Thames’s tributaries;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I know these slopes; who knows them if not I?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But many a dingle on the loved hill-side,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With thorns once studded, old, white-blossom’d trees,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where thick the cowslips grew, and far descried</span>
						<br/>
				<span>High tower’d the spikes of purple orchises,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath since our day put by</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The coronals of that forgotten time;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down each green bank hath gone the ploughboy’s team,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And only in the hidden brookside gleam</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Primroses, orphans of the flowery prime.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where is the girl, who by the boatman’s door,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Above the locks, above the boating throng,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Unmoor’d our skiff when through the Wytham flats,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Red loosestrife and blond meadow-sweet among</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And darting swallows and light water-gnats,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We track’d the shy Thames shore?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where are the mowers, who, as the tiny swell</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of our boat passing heaved the river-grass,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stood with suspended scythe to see us pass?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They all are gone, and thou art gone as well!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, thou art gone! and round me too the night</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In ever-nearing circle weaves her shade.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I see her veil draw soft across the day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I feel her slowly chilling breath invade</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The cheek grown thin, the brown hair sprent with grey;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I feel her finger light</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Laid pausefully upon life’s headlong train;⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The foot less prompt to meet the morning dew,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The heart less bounding at emotion new,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And hope, once crush’d, less quick to spring again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And long the way appears, which seem’d so short</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To the less practised eye of sanguine youth;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And high the mountain-tops, in cloudy air,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The mountain-tops where is the throne of Truth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tops in life’s morning-sun so bright and bare!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Unbreachable the fort</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the long-batter’d world uplifts its wall;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And strange and vain the earthly turmoil grows,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And near and real the charm of thy repose,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And night as welcome as a friend would fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But hush! the upland hath a sudden loss</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of quiet!⁠—Look, adown the dusk hill-side,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A troop of Oxford hunters going home,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As in old days, jovial and talking, ride!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From hunting with the Berkshire hounds they come.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Quick! let me fly, and cross</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Into yon farther field!⁠—’Tis done; and see,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Back’d by the sunset, which doth glorify</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The orange and pale violet evening-sky,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bare on its lonely ridge, the Tree! the Tree!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I take the omen! Eve lets down her veil,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The white fog creeps from bush to bush about,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The west unflushes, the high stars grow bright,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And in the scatter’d farms the lights come out.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I cannot reach the signal-tree to-night,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet, happy omen, hail!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hear it from thy broad lucent Arno-vale</span>
						<br/>
				<span>(For there thine earth-forgetting eyelids keep</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The morningless and unawakening sleep</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Under the flowery oleanders pale),</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hear it, O Thyrsis, still our tree is there!⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah, vain! These English fields, this upland dim,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>These brambles pale with mist engarlanded,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That lone, sky-pointing tree, are not for him;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To a boon southern country he is fled,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And now in happier air,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wandering with the great Mother’s train divine</span>
						<br/>
				<span>(And purer or more subtle soul than thee,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I trow, the mighty Mother doth not see)</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Within a folding of the Apennine,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou hearest the immortal chants of old!⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Putting his sickle to the perilous grain</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the hot cornfield of the Phrygian king,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For thee the Lityerses-song again</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Young Daphnis with his silver voice doth sing;<a id="FNanchor_18_20" name="FNanchor_18_20"/><a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_18_20">[18]</a></span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sings his Sicilian fold,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His sheep, his hapless love, his blinded eyes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And how a call celestial round him rang,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And heavenward from the fountain-brink he sprang,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And all the marvel of the golden skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There thou art gone, and me thou leavest here</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sole in these fields! yet will I not despair.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Despair I will not, while I yet descry</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Neath the mild canopy of English air</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That lonely tree against the western sky.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still, still these slopes, ’tis clear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our Gipsy-Scholar haunts, outliving thee!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fields where soft sheep from cages pull the hay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Woods with anemonies in flower till May,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Know him a wanderer still; then why not me?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A fugitive and gracious light he seeks,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shy to illumine; and I seek it too.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This does not come with houses or with gold,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With place, with honour, and a flattering crew;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Tis not in the world’s market bought and sold⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But the smooth-slipping weeks</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Drop by, and leave its seeker still untired;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Out of the heed of mortals he is gone,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He wends unfollow’d, he must house alone;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet on he fares, by his own heart inspired.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou too, O Thyrsis, on like quest wast bound;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou wanderedst with me for a little hour!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Men gave thee nothing; but this happy quest,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If men esteem’d thee feeble, gave thee power,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If men procured thee trouble, gave thee rest.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And this rude Cumner ground,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its fir-topped Hurst, its farms, its quiet fields,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here cam’st thou in thy jocund youthful time,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here was thine height of strength, thy golden prime!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And still the haunt beloved a virtue yields.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What though the music of thy rustic flute</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Kept not for long its happy, country tone;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lost it too soon, and learnt a stormy note</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of men contention-tost, of men who groan,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which task’d thy pipe too sore, and tired thy throat⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It fail’d, and thou wast mute!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet hadst thou alway visions of our light,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And long with men of care thou couldst not stay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And soon thy foot resumed its wandering way,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Left human haunt, and on alone till night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>‘Mid city-noise, not, as with thee of yore,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thyrsis! in reach of sheep-bells is my home.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Then through the great town’s harsh, heart-wearying roar,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let in thy voice a whisper often come,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To chase fatigue and fear:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Why faintest thou? I wander’d till I died.</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Roam on! The light we sought is shining still.</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Dost thou ask proof? Our tree yet crowns the hill,</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Our Scholar travels yet the loved hill-side.</i>

			<h2 epub:type="title">EPILOGUE TO LESSING’S LAOCOöN</h2>
			<p>
				<span>One morn as through Hyde Park we walk’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My friend and I, by chance we talk’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Lessing’s famed Laocoön;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And after we awhile had gone</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In Lessing’s track, and tried to see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What painting is, what poetry⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Diverging to another thought,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Ah,” cries my friend, “but who hath taught</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Why music and the other arts</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Oftener perform aright their parts</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Than poetry? why she, than they,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fewer fine successes can display?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For ’tis so, surely! Even in Greece,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where best the poet framed his piece,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Even in that Phœbus-guarded ground</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pausanias on his travels found</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Good poems, if he look’d, more rare</span>
						<br/>
				<span>(Though many) than good statues were⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For these, in truth, were everywhere.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of bards full many a stroke divine</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In Dante’s, Petrarch’s, Tasso’s line,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The land of Ariosto show’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And yet, e’en there, the canvas glow’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With triumphs, a yet ampler brood,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Raphael and his brotherhood.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And nobly perfect, in our day</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of haste, half-work, and disarray,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Profound yet touching, sweet yet strong,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath risen Goethe’s, Wordsworth’s song;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet even I (and none will bow</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Deeper to these) must needs allow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They yield us not, to soothe our pains,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Such multitude of heavenly strains</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As from the kings of sound are blown,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While thus my friend discoursed, we pass</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Out of the path, and take the grass.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The grass had still the green of May,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And still the unblacken’d elms were gay;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The kine were resting in the shade,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The flies a summer-murmur made.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bright was the morn and south the air;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The soft-couch’d cattle were as fair</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As those which pastured by the sea,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That old-world morn, in Sicily,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When on the beach the Cyclops lay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Galatea from the bay</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mock’d her poor lovelorn giant’s lay.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Behold,” I said, “the painter’s sphere!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The limits of his art appear.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The passing group, the summer-morn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The grass, the elms, that blossom’d thorn⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Those cattle couch’d, or, as they rise,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their shining flanks, their liquid eyes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>These, or much greater things, but caught</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like these, and in one aspect brought!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In outward semblance he must give</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A moment’s life of things that live;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then let him choose his moment well,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With power divine its story tell.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still we walk’d on, in thoughtful mood,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And now upon the bridge we stood.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Full of sweet breathings was the air,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of sudden stirs and pauses fair.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down o’er the stately bridge the breeze</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Came rustling from the garden-trees</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And on the sparkling waters play’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Light-plashing waves an answer made,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And mimic boats their haven near’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beyond, the Abbey-towers appear’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By mist and chimneys unconfined,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Free to the sweep of light and wind;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>While through their earth-moor’d nave below</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Another breath of wind doth blow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sound as of wandering breeze⁠—but sound</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In laws by human artists bound.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“The world of music!” I exclaim’d:⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“This breeze that rustles by, that famed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Abbey recall it! what a sphere</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Large and profound, hath genius here!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The inspired musician what a range,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What power of passion, wealth of change!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some source of feeling he must choose</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And its lock’d fount of beauty use,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And through the stream of music tell</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its else unutterable spell;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To choose it rightly is his part,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And press into its inmost heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“<i>Miserere, Domine!</i></span>
						<br/>
				<span>The words are utter’d, and they flee.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Deep is their penitential moan,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mighty their pathos, but ’tis gone.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They have declared the spirit’s sore</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sore load, and words can do no more.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beethoven takes them then⁠—those two</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Poor, bounded words⁠—and makes them new;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Infinite makes them, makes them young;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Transplants them to another tongue,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where they can now, without constraint,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pour all the soul of their complaint,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And roll adown a channel large</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The wealth divine they have in charge.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Page after page of music turn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And still they live and still they burn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Eternal, passion-fraught, and free⁠—</span>

				<span><i>Miserere, Domine!</i>”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Onward we moved, and reach’d the Ride</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where gaily flows the human tide.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Afar, in rest the cattle lay;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We heard, afar, faint music play;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But agitated, brisk, and near,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Men, with their stream of life, were here.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some hang upon the rails, and some</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On foot behind them go and come.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This through the Ride upon his steed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Goes slowly by, and this at speed.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The young, the happy, and the fair,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The old, the sad, the worn, were there;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some vacant, and some musing went,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And some in talk and merriment.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nods, smiles, and greetings, and farewells!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And now and then, perhaps, there swells</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A sigh, a tear⁠—but in the throng</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All changes fast, and hies along.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hies, ah, from whence, what native ground?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And to what goal, what ending, bound?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Behold, at last the poet’s sphere!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But who,” I said, “suffices here?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For, ah! so much he has to do;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Be painter and musician too!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The aspect of the moment show,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The feeling of the moment know!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The aspect not, I grant, express</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Clear as the painter’s art can dress;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The feeling not, I grant, explore</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So deep as the musician’s lore⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But clear as words can make revealing,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And deep as words can follow feeling.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, ah! then comes his sorest spell</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of toil⁠—he must life’s <i>movement</i> tell!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The thread which binds it all in one,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And not its separate parts alone.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The <i>movement</i> he must tell of life,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its pain and pleasure, rest and strife;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His eye must travel down, at full,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The long, unpausing spectacle;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With faithful unrelaxing force</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Attend it from its primal source,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From change to change and year to year</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Attend it of its mid career,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Attend it to the last repose</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And solemn silence of its close.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The cattle rising from the grass</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His thought must follow where they pass;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The penitent with anguish bow’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His thought must follow through the crowd.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yes! all this eddying, motley throng</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That sparkles in the sun along,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Girl, statesman, merchant, soldier bold,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Master and servant, young and old,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Grave, gay, child, parent, husband, wife,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He follows home, and lives their life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And many, many are the souls</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Life’s movement fascinates, controls;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It draws them on, they cannot save</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their feet from its alluring wave;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They cannot leave it, they must go</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With its unconquerable flow.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But ah! how few, of all that try</span>
						<br/>
				<span>This mighty march, do aught but die!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For ill-endow’d for such a way,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ill-stored in strength, in wits, are they.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They faint, they stagger to and fro,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And wandering from the stream they go;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In pain, in terror, in distress,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They see, all round, a wilderness.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sometimes a momentary gleam</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They catch of the mysterious stream;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sometimes, a second’s space, their ear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The murmur of its waves doth hear.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That transient glimpse in song they say,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But not as painter can pourtray⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That transient sound in song they tell,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But not, as the musician, well.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And when at last their snatches cease,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And they are silent and at peace,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The stream of life’s majestic whole</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath ne’er been mirror’d on their soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Only a few the life-stream’s shore</span>
						<br/>
				<span>With safe unwandering feet explore;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Untired its movement bright attend,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Follow its windings to the end.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then from its brimming waves their eye</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Drinks up delighted ecstasy,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And its deep-toned, melodious voice</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For ever makes their ear rejoice.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They speak! the happiness divine</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They feel, runs o’er in every line;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its spell is round them like a shower⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It gives them pathos, gives them power.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No painter yet hath such a way,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor no musician made, as they,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And gather’d on immortal knolls</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Such lovely flowers for cheering souls.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beethoven, Raphael, cannot reach</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The charm which Homer, Shakespeare, teach</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To these, to these, their thankful race</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gives, then, the first, the fairest place;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And brightest is their glory’s sheen,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For greatest hath their labour been.”</span>

			<p>
				<span>I ask not that my bed of death</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From bands of greedy heirs be free;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For these besiege the latest breath</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of fortune’s favour’d sons, not me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I ask not each kind soul to keep</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tearless, when of my death he hears.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let those who will, if any, weep!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There are worse plagues on earth than tears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I ask but that my death may find</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The freedom to my life denied;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ask but the folly of mankind</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then, then at last, to quit my side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spare me the whispering, crowded room,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The friends who come, and gape, and go;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The ceremonious air of gloom⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All, which makes death a hideous show!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor bring, to see me cease to live,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Some doctor full of phrase and fame,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To shake his sapient head, and give</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The ill he cannot cure a name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor fetch, to take the accustom’d toll</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the poor sinner bound for death,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His brother-doctor of the soul,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To canvass with official breath</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The future and its viewless things⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That undiscover’d mystery</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which one who feels death’s winnowing wings</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Must needs read clearer, sure, than he!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bring none of these; but let me be,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>While all around in silence lies,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Moved to the window near, and see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Once more, before my dying eyes,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bathed in the sacred dews of morn</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The wide aerial landscape spread⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The world which was ere I was born,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The world which lasts when I am dead;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Which never was the friend of <i>one</i>,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor promised love it could not give,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But lit for all its generous sun,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And lived itself, and made us live.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There let me gaze, till I become</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In soul, with what I gaze on, wed!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To feel the universe my home;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To have before my mind⁠—instead</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of the sick room, the mortal strife,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The turmoil for a little breath⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The pure eternal course of life,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not human combatings with death!]</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus feeling, gazing, might I grow</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Composed, refresh’d, ennobled, clear;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then willing let my spirit go</span>

				<span>White houses prank where once were huts.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Glion, but not the same!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And yet I know not! All unchanged</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The turf, the pines, the sky!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The hills in their old order ranged;</span>

				<span>The crackling husk-heaps burn, as if</span>

				<span>I left them yesterday!</span>

				<span>Across the valley, on that slope,</span>

				<span>Invite to rest the traveller there</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Before he climb the pass⁠—</span>

						<br/>
				<span>His birth-name just below;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Orchard, and croft, and full-stored grange</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nursed by his pastoral flow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But stop!⁠—to fetch back thoughts that stray</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Beyond this gracious bound,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The cone of Jaman, pale and grey,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>See, in the blue profound!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, Jaman! delicately tall</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Above his sun-warm’d firs⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What thoughts to me his rocks recall,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What memories he stirs!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And who but thou must be, in truth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Obermann! with me here?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou master of my wandering youth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But left this many a year!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, I forget the world’s work wrought,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its warfare waged with pain;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>An eremite with thee, in thought</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Once more I slip my chain,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And to thy mountain-chalet come,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And lie beside its door,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And hear the wild bee’s Alpine hum,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thy sad, tranquil lore!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Again I feel the words inspire</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their mournful calm; serene,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet tinged with infinite desire</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For all that <i>might</i> have been⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The harmony from which man swerved</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Made his life’s rule once more!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The universal order served,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Earth happier than before!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—While thus I mused, night gently ran</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down over hill and wood.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then, still and sudden, Obermann</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On the grass near me stood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Those pensive features well I knew,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On my mind, years before,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Imaged so oft! imaged so true!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—A shepherd’s garb he wore,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A mountain-flower was in his hand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A book was in his breast.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bent on my face, with gaze which scann’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My soul, his eyes did rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And is it thou,” he cried, “so long</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Held by the world which we</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Loved not, who turnest from the throng</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Back to thy youth and me?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And from thy world, with heart opprest,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Choosest thou <i>now</i> to turn?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah me! we anchorites read things best,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Clearest their course discern!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou fledst me when the ungenial earth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Man’s work-place, lay in gloom.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Return’st thou in her hour of birth,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of hopes and hearts in bloom?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Perceiv’st thou not the change of day?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah! Carry back thy ken,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What, some two thousand years! Survey</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The world as it was then!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Like ours it look’d in outward air.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its head was clear and true,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sumptuous its clothing, rich its fare,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No pause its action knew;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Stout was its arm, each thew and bone</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Seem’d puissant and alive⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, ah! its heart, its heart was stone,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And so it could not thrive!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“On that hard Pagan world disgust</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And secret loathing fell.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Deep weariness and sated lust</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Made human life a hell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In his cool hall, with haggard eyes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Roman noble lay;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He drove abroad, in furious guise,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Along the Appian way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He made a feast, drank fierce and fast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And crown’d his hair with flowers⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No easier nor no quicker pass’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The impracticable hours.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The brooding East with awe beheld</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Her impious younger world.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Roman tempest swell’d and swell’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And on her head was hurl’d.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The East bow’d low before the blast</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In patient, deep disdain;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She let the legions thunder past,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And plunged in thought again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So well she mused, a morning broke</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Across her spirit grey;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A conquering, new-born joy awoke,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And fill’d her life with day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Poor world,’ she cried, ‘so deep accurst,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That runn’st from pole to pole</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To seek a draught to slake thy thirst⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Go, seek it in thy soul!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She heard it, the victorious West,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In crown and sword array’d!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She felt the void which mined her breast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She shiver’d and obey’d.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She veil’d her eagles, snapp’d her sword,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And laid her sceptre down;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Her stately purple she abhorr’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And her imperial crown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She broke her flutes, she stopp’d her sports,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Her artists could not please;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She tore her books, she shut her courts,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She fled her palaces;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Lust of the eye and pride of life</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She left it all behind,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And hurried, torn with inward strife,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The wilderness to find.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Tears wash’d the trouble from her face!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>She changed into a child!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>‘Mid weeds and wrecks she stood⁠—a place</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of ruin⁠—but she smiled!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh, had I lived in that great day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>How had its glory new</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fill’d earth and heaven, and caught away</span>
						<br/>
				<span>My ravish’d spirit too!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No thoughts that to the world belong</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Had stood against the wave</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of love which set so deep and strong</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From Christ’s then open grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No cloister-floor of humid stone</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Had been too cold for me.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For me no Eastern desert lone</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Had been too far to flee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No lonely life had pass’d too slow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When I could hourly scan</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Upon his Cross, with head sunk low,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That nail’d, thorn-crowned Man!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Could see the Mother with her Child</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whose tender winning arts</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have to his little arms beguiled</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So many wounded hearts!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And centuries came and ran their course,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And unspent all that time</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still, still went forth that Child’s dear force,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And still was at its prime.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ay, ages long endured his span</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of life⁠—’tis true received⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That gracious Child, that thorn-crown’d Man!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—He lived while we believed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“While we believed, on earth he went,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And open stood his grave.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Men call’d from chamber, church, and tent;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Christ was by to save.</span>

			<p>
				<span>“He breaks the winter of the past;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A green, new earth appears.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Millions, whose life in ice lay fast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Have thoughts, and smiles, and tears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>

				<span>Death’s frozen hour is done!</span>

						<br/>
				<span>With happier zeal pursued.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With hope extinct and brow composed</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I mark’d the present die;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Its term of life was nearly closed,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet it had more than I.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But thou, though to the world’s new hour</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou come with aspect marr’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shorn of the joy, the bloom, the power</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which best befits its bard⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Though more than half thy years be past,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And spent thy youthful prime;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though, round thy firmer manhood cast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hang weeds of our sad time</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Whereof thy youth felt all the spell,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And traversed all the shade⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though late, though dimm’d, though weak, yet tell</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hope to a world new-made!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Help it to fill that deep desire,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The want which rack’d our brain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Consumed our heart with thirst like fire,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Immedicable pain;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Which to the wilderness drove out</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our life, to Alpine snow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And palsied all our word with doubt,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And all our work with woe⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What still of strength is left, employ</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That end to help attain:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>One common wave of thought and joy</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span><i>Lifting mankind again</i>!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—The vision ended. I awoke</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As out of sleep, and no</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Voice moved;⁠—only the torrent broke</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The silence, far below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soft darkness on the turf did lie.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Solemn, o’er hut and wood,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In the yet star-sown nightly sky,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The peak of Jaman stood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still in my soul the voice I heard</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Obermann!⁠⸺⁠away</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I turned; by some vague impulse stirr’d,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Along the rocks of Naye</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Past Sonchaud’s piny flanks I gaze</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the blanch’d summit bare</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Malatrait, to where in haze</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Valais opens fair,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the domed Velan, with his snows,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Behind the upcrowding hills,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Doth all the heavenly opening close</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which the Rhone’s murmur fills;⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And glorious there, without a sound,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Across the glimmering lake,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>High in the Valais-depth profound,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I saw the morning break.</span>

				<span>What is it to grow old?</span>

				<span>The lustre of the eye?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is it for beauty to forego her wreath?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Yes, but not this alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Is it to feel our strength⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Not our bloom only, but our strength⁠—decay?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Is it to feel each limb</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Grow stiffer, every function less exact,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Each nerve more loosely strung?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, this, and more; but not</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah, ’tis not what in youth we dream’d ’twould be!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Tis not to have our life</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mellow’d and soften’d as with sunset-glow,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A golden day’s decline.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis not to see the world</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As from a height, with rapt prophetic eyes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And heart profoundly stirr’d;</span>
						<br/>

				<span>It is to spend long days</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And not once feel that we were ever young;</span>

				<span>In the hot prison of the present, month</span>

				<span>To month with weary pain.</span>

				<span>Festers the dull remembrance of a change,</span>

			<p>
				<span>It is⁠—last stage of all⁠—</span>

				<span>Youth rambles on life’s arid mount,</span>

				<span>Four years!⁠—and didst thou stay above</span>

				<span>And all that life, and all that love,</span>

				<span>Seem’d surging the Virgilian cry,<a id="FNanchor_B_2" name="FNanchor_B_2"/><a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_B_2">[B]</a></span>

				<span>The sense of tears in mortal things⁠—</span>

			<p>
				<span>That steadfast, mournful strain, consoled</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By spirits gloriously gay,</span>

				<span>And temper of heroic mould⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What, was four years their whole short day?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, only four!⁠—and not the course</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of all the centuries yet to come,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And not the infinite resource</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of Nature, with her countless sum</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of figures, with her fulness vast</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of new creation evermore,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Can ever quite repeat the past,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or just thy little self restore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stern law of every mortal lot!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which man, proud man, finds hard to bear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And builds himself I know not what</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of second life I know not where.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But thou, when struck thine hour to go,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On us, who stood despondent by,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A meek last glance of love didst throw,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And humbly lay thee down to die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet would we keep thee in our heart⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Would fix our favourite on the scene,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nor let thee utterly depart</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And be as if thou ne’er hadst been.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so there rise these lines of verse</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On lips that rarely form them now;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>While to each other we rehearse:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Such ways, such arts, such looks hadst thou!</i>
					
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We stroke thy broad brown paws again,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We bid thee to thy vacant chair,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We greet thee by the window-pane,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We hear thy scuffle on the stair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We see the flaps of thy large ears</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Quick raised to ask which way we go;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Crossing the frozen lake, appears</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thy small black figure on the snow!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor to us only art thou dear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who mourn thee in thine English home;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou hast thine absent master’s tear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dropt by the far Australian foam.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thy memory lasts both here and there,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thou shall live as long as we.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And after that⁠—thou dost not care!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In us was all the world to thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet, fondly zealous for thy fame,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Even to a date beyond our own</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We strive to carry down thy name,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By mounded turf, and graven stone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We lay thee, close within our reach,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here, where the grass is smooth and warm,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Between the holly and the beech,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Where oft we watch’d thy couchant form,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Asleep, yet lending half an ear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To travellers on the Portsmouth road;⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There build we thee, O guardian dear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mark’d with a stone, thy last abode!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then some, who through this garden pass,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When we too, like thyself, are clay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shall see thy grave upon the grass,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And stop before the stone, and say:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<i>People who lived here long ago</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Did by this stone, it seems, intend</i>
					
				</span>

					<i>To name for future times to know</i>

				<span>The presence of that gracious inmate, light?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A child of light appear’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hither he came, late-born and long-desired,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And to men’s hearts this ancient place endear’d;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What, is the happy glow so soon expired?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—Rough was the winter eve;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their craft the fishers leave,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And down over the Thames the darkness drew.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>One still lags last, and turns, and eyes the Pile</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Huge in the gloom, across in Thorney Isle,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>King Sebert’s work, the wondrous Minster new.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—’Tis Lambeth now, where then</span>
						<br/>
				<span>They moor’d their boats among the bulrush stems;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And that new Minster in the matted fen</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The world-famed Abbey by the westering Thames.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His mates are gone, and he</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For mist can scarcely see</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A strange wayfarer coming to his side⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who bade him loose his boat, and fix his oar,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And row him straightway to the further shore,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And wait while he did there a space abide.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The fisher awed obeys,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That voice had note so clear of sweet command;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Through pouring tide he pulls, and drizzling haze,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And sets his freight ashore on Thorney strand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Minster’s outlined mass</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rose dim from the morass,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thitherward the stranger took his way.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lo, on a sudden all the Pile is bright!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nave, choir and transept glorified with light,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>While tongues of fire on coign and carving play!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And heavenly odours fair</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Come streaming with the floods of glory in,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And carols float along the happy air,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As if the reign of joy did now begin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then all again is dark;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And by the fisher’s bark</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The unknown passenger returning stands.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>O Saxon fisher! thou hast had with thee</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>The fisher from the Lake of Galilee⁠—</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So saith he, blessing him with outspread hands;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then fades, but speaks the while:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>At dawn thou to King Sebert shalt relate</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>How his St. Peter’s Church in Thorney Isle</i>
					
				</span>
						<br/>
				<span>
					<i>Peter, his friend, with light did consecrate.</i>
					
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Twelve hundred years and more</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Along the holy floor</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pageants have pass’d, and tombs of mighty kings</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Efface the humbler graves of Sebert’s line,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And, as years sped, the minster-aisles divine</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Grew used to the approach of Glory’s wings.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Arts came, and arms, and law,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And majesty, and sacred form and fear;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Only that primal guest the fisher saw,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Light, only light, was slow to reappear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Saviour’s happy light,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wherein at first was dight</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His boon of life and immortality,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In desert ice of subtleties was spent</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or drown’d in mists of childish wonderment,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fond fancies here, there false philosophy!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And harsh the temper grew</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of men with mind thus darken’d and astray;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And scarce the boon of life could struggle through,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For want of light which should the boon convey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet in this latter time</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The promise of the prime</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Seem’d to come true at last, O Abbey old!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>It seem’d, a child of light did bring the dower</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Foreshown thee in thy consecration-hour,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And in thy courts his shining freight unroll’d:</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bright wits, and instincts sure,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And goodness warm, and truth without alloy,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And temper sweet, and love of all things pure,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And joy in light, and power to spread the joy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And on that countenance bright</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shone oft so high a light,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That to my mind there came how, long ago,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Lay on the hearth, amid a fiery ring,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The charm’d babe of the Eleusinian king⁠—<a id="FNanchor_34_36" name="FNanchor_34_36"/><a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_34_36">[34]</a></span>
						<br/>
				<span>His nurse, the Mighty Mother, will’d it so.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Warm in her breast, by day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He slumber’d, and ambrosia balm’d the child;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But all night long amid the flames he lay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Upon the hearth, and play’d with them, and smiled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But once, at midnight deep,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>His mother woke from sleep,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And saw her babe amidst the fire, and scream’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A sigh the Goddess gave, and with a frown</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pluck’d from the fire the child, and laid him down;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then raised her face, and glory round her stream’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The mourning-stole no more</span>

				<span>But raiment of celestial sheen she wore,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And beauty fill’d her, and she spake aloud:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O ignorant race of man!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Achieve your good who can,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If your own hands the good begun undo?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Had human cry not marr’d the work divine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Immortal had I made this boy of mine;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But now his head to death again is due</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I have now no power</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Unto this pious household to repay</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Their kindness shown me in my wandering hour.”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—She spake, and from the portal pass’d away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Boy his nurse forgot,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And bore a mortal lot.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Long since, his name is heard on earth no more.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In some chance battle on Cithæron-side</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The nursling of the Mighty Mother died,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And went where all his fathers went before.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—On thee too, in thy day</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of childhood, Arthur! did some check have power,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That, radiant though thou wert, thou couldst but stay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Bringer of heavenly light, a human hour?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Therefore our happy guest</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Knew care, and knew unrest,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And weakness warn’d him, and he fear’d decline.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And in the grave he laid a cherish’d wife,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And men ignoble harass’d him with strife,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And deadly airs his strength did undermine.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Then from his Abbey fades</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The sound beloved of his victorious breath;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And light’s fair nursling stupor first invades,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And next the crowning impotence of death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But hush! This mournful strain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which would of death complain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The oracle forbade, not ill-inspired.⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>That Pair, whose head did plan, whose hands did forge</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The Temple in the pure Parnassian gorge,<a id="FNanchor_35_37" name="FNanchor_35_37"/><a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_35_37">[35]</a></span>
						<br/>
				<span>Finish’d their work, and then a meed required.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Seven days,” the God replied,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“Live happy, then expect your perfect meed!”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Quiet in sleep, the seventh night, they died.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Death, death was judged the boon supreme indeed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And truly he who here</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hath run his bright career,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And served men nobly, and acceptance found,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And borne to light and right his witness high,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What could he better wish than then to die,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And wait the issue, sleeping underground?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Why should he pray to range</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down the long age of truth that ripens slow;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And break his heart with all the baffling change,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And all the tedious tossing to and fro?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For this and that way swings</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The flux of mortal things,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though moving inly to one far-set goal.⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What had our Arthur gain’d, to stop and see,</span><br/>
						<br/>
				<span>After light’s term, a term of cecity,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A Church once large and then grown strait in soul?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To live, and see arise,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Alternating with wisdom’s too short reign,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Folly revived, re-furbish’d sophistries,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And pullulating rites externe and vain?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ay me! ’Tis deaf, that ear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which joy’d my voice to hear;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet would I not disturb thee from thy tomb,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thus sleeping in thine Abbey’s friendly shade,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And the rough waves of life for ever laid!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>I would not break thy rest, nor change thy doom.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Even as my father, thou⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Even as that loved, that well-recorded friend⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hast thy commission done; ye both may now</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wait for the leaven to work, the let to end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thou, O Abbey grey!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Predestined to the ray</span>
						<br/>
				<span>By this dear guest over thy precinct shed⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fear not but that thy light once more shall burn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Once more thine immemorial gleam return,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Though sunk be now this bright, this gracious head!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Let but the light appear</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thy transfigured walls be touch’d with flame⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our Arthur will again be present here,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Again from lip to lip will pass his name.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Poor Matthias!⁠—Found him lying</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fall’n beneath his perch and dying?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Found him stiff, you say, though warm⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All convulsed his little form?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Poor canary! many a year</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Well he knew his mistress dear;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Now in vain you call his name,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Vainly raise his rigid frame,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Vainly warm him in your breast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Vainly kiss his golden crest,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Smooth his ruffled plumage fine,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Touch his trembling beak with wine.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>One more gasp⁠—it is the end!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dead and mute our tiny friend!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Songster thou of many a year,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Now thy mistress brings thee here,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Says, it fits that I rehearse,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tribute due to thee, a verse,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Meed for daily song of yore</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Silent now for evermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Poor Matthias! Wouldst thou have</span>
						<br/>
				<span>More than pity? claim’st a stave?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Friends more near us than a bird</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We dismiss’d without a word.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Rover, with the good brown head,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Great Atossa, they are dead;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dead, and neither prose nor rhyme</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tells the praises of their prime.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou didst know them old and grey,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Know them in their sad decay.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou hast seen Atossa sage</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sit for hours beside thy cage;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Thou wouldst chirp, thou foolish bird,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Flutter, chirp⁠—she never stirr’d!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What were now these toys to her?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down she sank amid her fur;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Eyed thee with a soul resign’d⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And thou deemedst cats were kind!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Cruel, but composed and bland,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dumb, inscrutable and grand,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>So Tiberius might have sat,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Had Tiberius been a cat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rover died⁠—Atossa too.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Less than they to us are you!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Nearer human were their powers,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Closer knit their life with ours.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Hands had stroked them, which are cold,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Now for years, in churchyard mould;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Comrades of our past were they,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of that unreturning day.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Changed and aging, they and we</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dwelt, it seem’d, in sympathy.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Alway from their presence broke</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Somewhat which remembrance woke</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of the loved, the lost, the young⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yet they died, and died unsung.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Geist came next, our little friend;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Geist had verse to mourn his end.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Yes, but that enforcement strong</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Which compell’d for Geist a song⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All that gay courageous cheer,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>All that human pathos dear;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Soul-fed eyes with suffering worn,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pain heroically borne,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Faithful love in depth divine⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Poor Matthias, were they thine?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Max and Kaiser we to-day</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Greet upon the lawn at play;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Max a dachshound without blot⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Kaiser should be, but is not.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Max, with shining yellow coat,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Prinking ears and dewlap throat⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Kaiser, with his collie face,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Penitent for want of race.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Which may be the first to die,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Vain to augur, they or I!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, as age comes on, I know,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Poet’s fire gets faint and low;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>If so be that travel they</span>
						<br/>
				<span>First the inevitable way,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Much I doubt if they shall have</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dirge from me to crown their grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet, poor bird, thy tiny corse</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Moves me, somehow, to remorse;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Something haunts my conscience, brings</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sad, compunctious visitings.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Other favourites, dwelling here,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Open lived to us, and near;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Well we knew when they were glad,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Plain we saw if they were sad,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Joy’d with them when they were gay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Soothed them in their last decay;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sympathy could feel and show</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Both in weal of theirs and woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Birds, companions more unknown,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Live beside us, but alone;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Finding not, do all they can,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Passage from their souls to man.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Kindness we bestow, and praise,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Laud their plumage, greet their lays;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Still, beneath their feather’d breast,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stirs a history unexpress’d.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Wishes there, and feelings strong,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Incommunicably throng;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What they want, we cannot guess,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fail to track their deep distress⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dull look on when death is nigh,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Note no change, and let them die.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Poor Matthias! couldst thou speak,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What a tale of thy last week!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Every morning did we pay</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stupid salutations gay,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Suited well to health, but how</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mocking, how incongruous now!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cake we offer’d, sugar, seed,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Never doubtful of thy need;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Praised, perhaps, thy courteous eye,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Praised thy golden livery.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Gravely thou the while, poor dear!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Sat’st upon thy perch to hear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fixing with a mute regard</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Us, thy human keepers hard,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Troubling, with our chatter vain,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ebb of life, and mortal pain⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Us, unable to divine</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Our companion’s dying sign,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or o’erpass the severing sea</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Set betwixt ourselves and thee,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Till the sand thy feathers smirch</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fallen dying off thy perch!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Was it, as the Grecian sings,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Birds were born the first of things,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Before the sun, before the wind,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Before the gods, before mankind,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Airy, ante-mundane throng⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Witness their unworldly song!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Proof they give, too, primal powers,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of a prescience more than ours⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Teach us, while they come and go,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>When to sail, and when to sow.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Cuckoo calling from the hill,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Swallow skimming by the mill,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Swallows trooping in the sedge,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Starlings swirling from the hedge,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Mark the seasons, map our year,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>As they show and disappear.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, with all this travail sage</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Brought from that anterior age,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Goes an unreversed decree</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Whereby strange are they and we;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Making want of theirs, and plan,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Indiscernible by man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No, away with tales like these</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stol’n from Aristophanes!<a id="FNanchor_36_38" name="FNanchor_36_38"/><a class="fnanchor" href="#Footnote_36_38">[36]</a></span>
						<br/>
				<span>Does it, if we miss your mind,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Prove us so remote in kind?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Birds! we but repeat on you</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What amongst ourselves we do.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Somewhat more or somewhat less,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>’Tis the same unskilfulness.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What you feel, escapes our ken⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Know we more our fellow men?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Human suffering at our side,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ah, like yours is undescried!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Human longings, human fears,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Miss our eyes and miss our ears.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Little helping, wounding much,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dull of heart, and hard of touch,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Brother man’s despairing sign</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who may trust us to divine?</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Who assure us, sundering powers</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stand not ’twixt his soul and ours?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Poor Matthias! See, thy end</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What a lesson doth it lend!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>For that lesson thou shalt have,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dead canary bird, a stave!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Telling how, one stormy day,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Stress of gale and showers of spray</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Drove my daughter small and me</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Inland from the rocks and sea.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Driv’n inshore, we follow down</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Ancient streets of Hastings town⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Slowly thread them⁠—when behold,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>French canary-merchant old</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Shepherding his flock of gold</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In a low dim-lighted pen</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Scann’d of tramps and fishermen!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>There a bird, high-coloured, fat,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Proud of port, though something squat⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Pursy, play’d-out Philistine⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Dazzled Nelly’s youthful eyne.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But, far in, obscure, there stirr’d</span>
						<br/>
				<span>On his perch a sprightlier bird,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Courteous-eyed, erect and slim;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And I whisper’d: “Fix on <i>him</i>!”</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Home we brought him, young and fair,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Songs to trill in Surrey air.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here Matthias sang his fill,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Saw the cedars of Pains Hill;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Here he pour’d his little soul,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Heard the murmur of the Mole.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Eight in number now the years</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He hath pleased our eyes and ears;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Other favourites he hath known</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Go, and now himself is gone.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>—Fare thee well, companion dear!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Fare for ever well, nor fear,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Tiny though thou art, to stray</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Down the uncompanion’d way!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>We without thee, little friend,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Many years have not to spend;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What are left, will hardly be</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Better than we spent with thee.</span>

			<p>
				<span>What, Kaiser dead? The heavy news</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Post-haste to Cobham calls the Muse,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>From where in Farringford she brews</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The ode sublime,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Or with Pen-bryn’s bold bard pursues</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A rival rhyme.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kai’s bracelet tail, Kai’s busy feet,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Were known to all the village-street.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“What, poor Kai dead?” say all I meet;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>“A loss indeed!”</span>

			<p>
				<span>Six years ago I brought him down,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A baby dog, from London town;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Round his small throat of black and brown</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A ribbon blue,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And vouch’d by glorious renown</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A dachshound true.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His mother, most majestic dame,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Of blood-unmix’d, from Potsdam came;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And Kaiser’s race we deem’d the same⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>No lineage higher.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And so he bore the imperial name.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But ah, his sire!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon, soon the days conviction bring.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The collie hair, the collie swing,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The tail’s indomitable ring,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The eye’s unrest⁠—</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The case was clear; a mongrel thing</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Kai stood confest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But all those virtues, which commend</span>
						<br/>
				<span>The humbler sort who serve and tend,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Were thine in store, thou faithful friend.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>What sense, what cheer!</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To us, declining tow’rds our end,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>A mate how dear!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Max, thy brother-dog, began</span>
						<br/>
				<span>To flag, and feel his narrowing span.</span>
						<br/>
				<span>And cold, besides, his blue blood ran,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Since, ’gainst the classes,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>He heard, of late, the Grand Old Man</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Incite the masses.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, Max and we grew slow and sad;</span>
						<br/>
				<span>But Kai, a tireless shepherd-lad,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Teeming with plans, alert, and glad</span>
						<br/>
				<span>In work or play,</span>
						<br/>
				<span>Like sunshine went and came, and bade</span>

				<i>Saw The Wide Prospect, and the Asian Fen.</i>
			</p>
			<p>The name Europe (Ευρωπη, <i>the wide prospect</i>) probably describes the appearance of the European coast to the Greeks on the coast of Asia Minor opposite. The name Asia, again, comes, it has been thought, from the muddy fens of the rivers of Asia Minor, such as the Cayster or Mæander, which struck the imagination of the Greeks living near them.</p>

				<i>Sohrab and Rustum.</i>
			</p>
			<p>The story of Sohrab and Rustum is told in Sir John Malcolm’s <i>History of Persia</i>, as follows:⁠—</p>
			<div class="blockquot">
				<p>“The young Sohrab was the fruit of one of Rustum’s early amours. He had left his mother, and sought fame under the banners of Afrasiab, whose armies he commanded, and soon obtained a renown beyond that of all contemporary heroes but his father. He had carried death and dismay into the ranks of the Persians, and had terrified the boldest warriors of that country, before Rustum encountered him, which at last that hero resolved to do, under a feigned name. They met three times. The first time they parted by mutual consent, though Sohrab had the advantage; the second, the youth obtained a victory, but granted life to his unknown father; the third was fatal to Sohrab, who, when writhing in the pangs of death, warned his conqueror to shun the vengeance that is inspired by parental woes, and bade him dread the rage of the mighty Rustum, who must soon learn that he had slain his son Sohrab. These words, we are told, were as death to the aged hero; and when he recovered from a trance, he called in despair for proofs of what Sohrab had said. The afflicted and dying youth tore open his mail, and showed his father a seal which his mother had placed on his arm when she discovered to him the secret of his birth, and bade him seek his father. The sight of his own signet rendered Rustum quite frantic; he cursed himself, attempting to put an end to his existence, and was only prevented by the efforts of his expiring son. After Sohrab’s death, he burnt his tents and all his goods, and carried the corpse to Seistan, where it was interred; the army of Turan was, agreeably to the last request of Sohrab, permitted to cross the Oxus unmolested. To reconcile us to the improbability of this tale, we are informed that Rustum could have no idea his son was in existence. The mother of Sohrab had written to him her child was a daughter, fearing to lose her darling infant if she revealed the truth; and Rustum, as before stated, fought under a feigned name, an usage not uncommon in the chivalrous combats of those days.”</p>

				<i>Balder Dead.</i>
			</p>
			<div class="blockquot">
				<p>“Balder the Good having been tormented with terrible dreams, indicating that his life was in great peril, communicated them to the assembled æsir, who resolved to conjure all things to avert from him the threatened danger. Then Frigga exacted an oath from fire and water, from iron, and all other metals, as well as from stones, earths, diseases, beasts, birds, poisons, and creeping things, that none of them would do any harm to Balder. When this was done, it became a favourite pastime of the æsir, at their meetings, to get Balder to stand up and serve them as a mark, some hurling darts at him, some stones, while others hewed at him with their swords and battle-axes, for do what they would, none of them could harm him, and this was regarded by all as a great honour shown to Balder. But when Loki beheld the scene he was sorely vexed that Balder was not hurt. Assuming, therefore, the shape of a woman, he went to Fensalir, the mansion of Frigga. That goddess, when she saw the pretended woman, inquired of her if she knew what the æsir were doing at their meetings. She replied, that they were throwing darts and stones at Balder without being able to hurt him.</p>
				<p>“ ‘Ay,’ said Frigga, ‘neither metal nor wood can hurt Balder, for I have exacted an oath from all of them.’</p>
				<p>“ ‘What!’ exclaimed the woman, ‘have all things sworn to spare Balder?’</p>
				<p>“ ‘All things,’ replied Frigga, ‘except one little shrub that grows on the eastern side of Valhalla, and is called Mistletoe, and which I thought too young and feeble to crave an oath from.’</p>
				<p>“As soon as Loki heard this he went away, and, resuming his natural shape, cut off the mistletoe, and repaired to the place where the gods were assembled. There he found Hödur standing apart, without partaking of the sports, on account of his blindness, and going up to him said, ‘Why dost thou not also throw something at Balder?’</p>
				<p>“ ‘Because I am blind,’ answered Hödur, ‘and see not where Balder is, and have, moreover, nothing to throw with.’</p>
				<p>“ ‘Come, then,’ said Loki, ‘do like the rest, and show honour to Balder by throwing this twig at him, and I will direct thy arm toward the place where he stands.’</p>
				<p>“Hödur then took the mistletoe, and, under the guidance of Loki, darted it at Balder, who, pierced through and through, fell down lifeless.”⁠—<i>Edda</i>.</p>

				<i>Tristram and Iseult.</i>
			</p>
			<div class="blockquot">
				<p>“In the court of his uncle King Marc, the king of Cornwall, who at this time resided at the castle of Tyntagel, Tristram became expert in all knightly exercises.⁠—The king of Ireland, at Tristram’s solicitations, promised to bestow his daughter Iseult in marriage on King Marc. The mother of Iseult gave to her daughter’s confidante a philtre, or love-potion, to be administered on the night of her nuptials. Of this beverage Tristram and Iseult, on their voyage to Cornwall, unfortunately partook. Its influence, during the remainder of their lives, regulated the affections and destiny of the lovers.⁠—</p>
				<p>“After the arrival of Tristram and Iseult in Cornwall, and the nuptials of the latter with King Marc, a great part of the romance is occupied with their contrivances to procure secret interviews.⁠—Tristram, being forced to leave Cornwall, on account of the displeasure of his uncle, repaired to Brittany, where lived Iseult with the White Hands.⁠—He married her⁠—more out of gratitude than love.⁠—Afterwards he proceeded to the dominions of Arthur, which became the theatre of unnumbered exploits.</p>
				<p>“Tristram, subsequent to these events, returned to Brittany, and to his long-neglected wife. There, being wounded and sick, he was soon reduced to the lowest ebb. In this situation, he despatched a confidant to the queen of Cornwall, to try if he could induce her to follow him to Brittany, etc.”⁠—<span class="smcap">Dunlop’s</span> <i>History of Fiction</i>.</p>

				<i>The Scholar-Gipsy.</i>
			</p>
			<div class="blockquot">
				<p>“There was very lately a lad in the University of Oxford, who was by his poverty forced to leave his studies there; and at last to join himself to a company of vagabond gipsies. Among these extravagant people, by the insinuating subtilty of his carriage, he quickly got so much of their love and esteem as that they discovered to him their mystery. After he had been a pretty while exercised in the trade, there chanced to ride by a couple of scholars, who had formerly been of his acquaintance. They quickly spied out their old friend among the gipsies; and he gave them an account of the necessity which drove him to that kind of life, and told them that the people he went with were not such impostors as they were taken for, but that they had a traditional kind of learning among them, and could do wonders by the power of imagination, their fancy binding that of others: that himself had learned much of their art, and when he had compassed the whole secret, he intended, he said, to leave their company, and give the world an account of what he had learned.”⁠—<span class="smcap">Glanvil’s</span> <i>Vanity of Dogmatizing</i>, 1661.</p>

				<i>Young Daphnis with his silver voice doth sing.</i>
			</p>
			<div class="blockquot">
				<p>Daphnis, the ideal Sicilian shepherd of Greek pastoral poetry, was said to have followed into Phrygia his mistress Piplea, who had been carried off by robbers, and to have found her in the power of the king of Phrygia, Lityerses. Lityerses used to make strangers try a contest with him in reaping corn, and to put them to death if he overcame them. Hercules arrived in time to save Daphnis, took upon himself the reaping-contest with Lityerses, overcame him, and slew him. The Lityerses-song connected with this tradition was, like the Linus-song, one of the early plaintive strains of Greek popular poetry, and used to be sung by corn-reapers. Other traditions represented Daphnis as beloved by a nymph who exacted from him an oath to love no one else. He fell in love with a princess, and was struck blind by the jealous nymph. Mercury, who was his father, raised him to Heaven, and made a fountain spring up in the place from which he ascended. At this fountain the Sicilians offered yearly sacrifices.⁠—See Servius, <i>Comment. in Virgil. Bucol.</i>, v. 20, and viii. 68.</p>

			<p>The author of <i>Obermann</i>, étienne Pivert de Senancour, has little celebrity in France, his own country; and out of France he is almost unknown. But the profound inwardness, the austere sincerity, of his principal work, <i>Obermann</i>, the delicate feeling for nature which it exhibits, and the melancholy eloquence of many passages of it, have attracted and charmed some of the most remarkable spirits of this century, such as George Sand and Sainte-Beuve, and will probably always find a certain number of spirits whom they touch and interest.</p>
			<p>Senancour was born in 1770. He was educated for the priesthood, and passed some time in the seminary of St. Sulpice; broke away from the Seminary and from France itself, and passed some years in Switzerland, where he married; returned to France in middle life, and followed thenceforward the career of a man of letters, but with hardly any fame or success. He died an old man in 1846, desiring that on his grave might be placed these words only: <i>éternité, deviens mon asile!</i></p>
			<p>The influence of Rousseau, and certain affinities with more famous and fortunate authors of his own day⁠—Chateaubriand and Madame de Staël⁠—are everywhere visible in Senancour. But though, like these eminent personages, he may be called a sentimental writer, and though <i>Obermann</i>, a collection of letters from Switzerland treating almost entirely of nature and of the human soul, may be called a work of sentiment, Senancour has a gravity and severity which distinguish him from all other writers of the sentimental school. The world is with him in his solitude far less than it is with them; of all writers he is the most perfectly isolated and the least attitudinising. His chief work, too, has a value and power of its own, apart from these merits of its author. The stir of all the main forces, by which modern life is and has been impelled, lives in the letters of <i>Obermann</i>; the dissolving agencies of the eighteenth century, the fiery storm of the French Revolution, the first faint promise and dawn of that new world which our own time is but now more fully bringing to light⁠—all these are to be felt, almost to be touched, there. To me, indeed, it will always seem that the impressiveness of this production can hardly be rated too high.</p>
			<p>Besides <i>Obermann</i> there is one other of Senancour’s works which, for those spirits who feel his attraction, is very interesting; its title is, <i>Libres Méditations d’un Solitaire Inconnu</i>.</p>

				<p>“Ailred of Rievaulx, and several other writers, assert that Sebert, king of the East Saxons and nephew of Ethelbert, founded the Abbey of Westminster very early in the seventh century.</p>
				<p>“Sulcardus, who lived in the time of William the Conqueror, gives a minute account of the miracle supposed to have been worked at the consecration of the Abbey.</p>
				<p>“The church had been prepared against the next day for dedication. On the night preceding, St. Peter appeared on the opposite side of the water to a fisherman, desiring to be conveyed to the farther shore. Having left the boat, St. Peter ordered the fisherman to wait, promising him a reward on his return. An innumerable host from heaven accompanied the apostle, singing choral hymns, while everything was illuminated with a supernatural light. The dedication having been completed, St. Peter returned to the fisherman, quieted his alarm at what had passed, and announced himself as the apostle. He directed the fisherman to go as soon as it was day to the authorities, to state what he had seen and heard, and to inform them that, in corroboration of his testimony, they would find the marks of consecration on the walls of the church. In obedience to the apostle’s direction, the fisherman waited on Mellitus, Bishop of London, who, going to the church, found not only marks of the chrism, but of the tapers with which the church had been illuminated. Mellitus, therefore, desisted from proceeding to a new consecration, and contented himself with the celebration of the mass.”⁠—<span class="smcap">Dugdale</span>, <i>Monasticon Anglicanum</i> (edition of 1817), vol. i. pp. 265, 266.
